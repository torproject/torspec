1. Scope and preliminaries

  This document describes the format of Tor's Bandwidth File, version
  1.0.0 and later.

  It is a new specification for the existing bandwidth file format,
  which we call version 1.0.0. It also specifies new format versions
  1.1.0 and later, which are backwards compatible with 1.0.0 parsers.

  Since Tor version 0.2.4.12-alpha, the directory authorities use
  the Bandwidth File file called "V3BandwidthsFile" generated by
  Torflow [1]. The details of this format are described in Torflow's
  README.spec.txt. We also summarise the format in this specification.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    RFC 2119.

1.2. Acknowledgements

  The original bandwidth generator (Torflow) and format was
  created by mike. Teor suggested to write this specification while
  contributing on pastly's new bandwidth generator implementation.

  This specification was revised after feedback from:

    Nick Mathewson (nickm)
    Iain Learmonth (irl)

1.3. Outline

  The Tor directory protocol (dir-spec.txt [3]) sections 3.4.1
  and 3.4.2, use the term bandwidth measurements, to refer to what
  here is called Bandwidth File.

  A Bandwidth File contains information on relays' bandwidth
  capacities and is produced by bandwidth generators, previously known
  as bandwidth scanners.

1.4. Format Versions

  1.0.0 - The legacy Bandwidth File format

  1.1.0 - Adds a header containing information about the bandwidth
          file. Document the sbws and Torflow relay line keys.

  1.2.0 - If there are not enough eligible relays, the bandwidth file
          SHOULD contain a header, but no relays. (To match Torflow's
          existing behaviour.)

          Adds scanner and destination countries to the header.
          Adds new KeyValue Lines to the Header List section with
          statistics about the number of relays included in the file.
          Adds new KeyValues to Relay Bandwidth Lines, with different
          bandwidth values (averages and descriptor bandwidths).

  1.4.0 - Adds monitoring KeyValues to the header and relay lines.

          RelayLines for excluded relays MAY be present in the bandwidth
          file for diagnostic reasons. Similarly, if there are not enough
          eligible relays, the bandwidth file MAY contain all known relays.

          Diagnostic relay lines SHOULD be marked with vote=0, and
          Tor SHOULD NOT use their bandwidths in its votes.

  1.5.0 - Add system information headers, as operating system, OpenSSL and
          Tor versions.

  All Tor versions can consume format version 1.0.0.

  All Tor versions can consume format version 1.1.0 and later,
  but Tor versions earlier than 0.3.5.1-alpha warn if the header
  contains any KeyValue lines after the Timestamp.

  Tor versions 0.4.0.3-alpha, 0.3.5.8, 0.3.4.11, and earlier do not
  understand "vote=0". Instead, they will vote for the actual bandwidths
  that sbws puts in diagnostic relay lines:
    * 1 for relays with "unmeasured=1", and
    * the relay's measured and scaled bandwidth when "under_min_report=1".

2. Format details

  The Bandwidth File MUST contain the following sections:
  - Header List (exactly once), which is a partially ordered list of
    - Header Lines (one or more times), then
  - Relay Lines (zero or more times), in an arbitrary order.
  If it does not contain these sections, parsers SHOULD ignore the file.

2.1. Definitions

  The following nonterminals are defined in Tor directory protocol
  sections 1.2., 2.1.1., 2.1.3.:

    bool
    Int
    SP (space)
    NL (newline)
    KeywordChar
    ArgumentChar
    nickname
    hexdigest (a '$', followed by 40 hexadecimal characters
      ([A-Fa-f0-9]))

  Nonterminal defined section 2 of version-spec.txt [4]:

    version_number

  We define the following nonterminals:

    Line ::= ArgumentChar* NL
    RelayLine ::= KeyValue (SP KeyValue)* NL
    HeaderLine ::= KeyValue NL
    KeyValue ::= Key "=" Value
    Key ::= (KeywordChar | "_")+
    Value ::= ArgumentCharValue+
    ArgumentCharValue ::= any printing ASCII character except NL and SP.
    Terminator ::= "=====" or "===="
                   Generators SHOULD use a 5-character terminator.
    Timestamp ::= Int
    Bandwidth ::= Int
    MasterKey ::= a base64-encoded Ed25519 public key, with
                  padding characters omitted.
    DateTime ::= "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS", as in ISO 8601
    CountryCode ::= Two capital ASCII letters ([A-Z]{2}), as defined in
                    ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 plus "ZZ" to denote unknown country
                    (eg the destination is in a Content Delivery Network).
    CountryCodeList ::= One or more CountryCode(s) separated by a comma
                        ([A-Z]{2}(,[A-Z]{2})*).

  Note that key_value and value are defined in Tor directory protocol
  with different formats to KeyValue and Value here.

  Tor versions earlier than 0.3.5.1-alpha require all lines in the file
  to be 510 characters or less. The previous limit was 254 characters in
  Tor 0.2.6.2-alpha and earlier. Parsers MAY ignore longer Lines.

  Note that directory authorities are only supported on the two most
  recent stable Tor versions, so we expect that line limits will be
  removed after Tor 0.4.0 is released in 2019.

2.2. Header List format

  It consists of a Timestamp line and zero or more HeaderLines.

  All the header lines MUST conform to the HeaderLine format, except
  the first Timestamp line.

  The Timestamp line is not a HeaderLine to keep compatibility with
  the legacy Bandwidth File format.

  Some header Lines MUST appear in specific positions, as documented
  below. All other Lines can appear in any order.

  If a parser does not recognize any extra material in a header Line,
  the Line MUST be ignored.

  If a header Line does not conform to this format, the Line SHOULD be
  ignored by parsers.

  It consists of:

    Timestamp NL

      [At start, exactly once.]

      The Unix Epoch time in seconds of the most recent generator bandwidth
      result.

      If the generator implementation has multiple threads or
      subprocesses which can fail independently, it SHOULD take the most
      recent timestamp from each thread and use the oldest value. This
      ensures all the threads continue running.

      If there are threads that do not run continuously, they SHOULD be
      excluded from the timestamp calculation.

      If there are no recent results, the generator MUST NOT generate a new
      file.

      It does not follow the KeyValue format for backwards compatibility
      with version 1.0.0.

    "version=" version_number NL

      [In second position, zero or one time.]

      The specification document format version.
      It uses semantic versioning [5].

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

      Version 1.0.0 documents do not contain this Line, and the
      version_number is considered to be "1.0.0".

    "software=" Value NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The name of the software that created the document.

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

      Version 1.0.0 documents do not contain this Line, and the software
      is considered to be "torflow".

    "software_version=" Value NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The version of the software that created the document.
      The version may be a version_number, a git commit, or some other
      version scheme.

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

    "file_created=" DateTime NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The date and time timestamp in ISO 8601 format and UTC time zone
      when the file was created.

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

    "generator_started=" DateTime NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The date and time timestamp in ISO 8601 format and UTC time zone
      when the generator started.

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

    "earliest_bandwidth=" DateTime NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The date and time timestamp in ISO 8601 format and UTC time zone
      when the first relay bandwidth was obtained.

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

    "latest_bandwidth=" DateTime NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The date and time timestamp in ISO 8601 format and UTC time zone
      of the most recent generator bandwidth result.

      This time MUST be identical to the initial Timestamp line.

      This duplicate value is included to make the format easier for people
      to read.

      This Line was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

    "number_eligible_relays=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays that have enough measurements to be
      included in the bandwidth file.

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "minimum_percent_eligible_relays=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The percentage of relays in the consensus that SHOULD be
      included in every generated bandwidth file.

      If this threshold is not reached, format versions 1.3.0 and earlier
      SHOULD NOT contain any relays. (Bandwidth files always include a
      header.)

      Format versions 1.4.0 and later SHOULD include all the relays for
      diagnostic purposes, even if this threshold is not reached. But these
      relays SHOULD be marked so that Tor does not vote on them.
      See section 1.4 for details.

      The minimum percentage is 60% in Torflow, so sbws uses
      60% as the default.

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "number_consensus_relays=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays in the consensus.

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "percent_eligible_relays=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of eligible relays, as a percentage of the number
      of relays in the consensus.

      This line SHOULD be equal to:
          (number_eligible_relays * 100.0) / number_consensus_relays
      to the number of relays in the consensus to include in this file.

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "minimum_number_eligible_relays=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The minimum number of relays that SHOULD be included in the bandwidth
      file. See minimum_percent_eligible_relays for details.

      This line SHOULD be equal to:
          number_consensus_relays * (minimum_percent_eligible_relays / 100.0)

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "scanner_country=" CountryCode NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The country, as in political geolocation, where the generator is run.

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "destinations_countries=" CountryCodeList NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The country, as in political geolocation, or countries where the
      destination Web server(s) are located.
      The destination Web Servers serve the data that the generator retrieves
      to measure the bandwidth.

      This Line was added in version 1.2.0 of this specification.

    "recent_consensus_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.].

      The number of the different consensuses seen in the last data_period
      days. (data_period is 5 by default.)

      Assuming that Tor clients fetch a consensus every 1-2 hours,
      and that the data_period is 5 days, the Value of this Key SHOULD be
      between:
          data_period * 24 / 2 =  60
          data_period * 24     = 120

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_priority_list_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of times that a list with a subset of relays prioritized
      to be measured has been created in the last data_period days.
      (data_period is 5 by default.)

      In 2019, with 7000 relays in the network, the Value of this Key SHOULD be
      approximately:
          data_period * 24 / 1.5 = 80
      Being 1.5 the approximate number of hours it takes to measure a
      priority list of 7000 * 0.05 (350) relays, when the fraction of relays
      in a priority list is the 5% (0.05).

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_priority_relay_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays that has been in in the list of relays prioritized
      to be measured in the last data_period days. (data_period is 5 by
      default.)

      In 2019, with 7000 relays in the network, the Value of this Key SHOULD be
      approximately:
          80 * (7000 * 0.05) = 28000
      Being 0.05 (5%) the fraction of relays in a priority list and 80
      the approximate number of priority lists (see
      "recent_priority_list_count").

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurement_attempt_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of times that any relay has been queued to be measured
      in the last data_period days. (data_period is 5 by default.)

      In 2019, with 7000 relays in the network, the Value of this Key SHOULD be
      approximately the same as "recent_priority_relay_count",
      assuming that there is one attempt to measure a relay for each relay that
      has been prioritized unless there are system, network or implementation
      issues.

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurement_failure_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of times that the scanner attempted to measure a relay in
      the last data_period days (5 by default), but the relay has not been
      measured because of system, network or implementation issues.

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurements_excluded_error_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays that have no successful measurements in the last
      data_period days (5 by default).

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurements_excluded_near_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays that have some successful measurements in the last
      data_period days (5 by default), but all those measurements were
      performed in a period of time that was too short (by default 1 day).

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurements_excluded_old_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays that have some successful measurements, but all
      those measurements are too old (more than 5 days, by default).

      Excludes relays that are already counted in
      recent_measurements_excluded_near_count.

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurements_excluded_few_count=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of relays that don't have enough recent successful
      measurements. (Fewer than 2 measurements in the last 5 days, by
      default).

      Excludes relays that are already counted in
      recent_measurements_excluded_near_count and
      recent_measurements_excluded_old_count.

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "time_to_report_half_network=" Int NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The time in seconds that it would take to report measurements about the
      half of the network, given the number of eligible relays and the time
      it took in the last days (5 days, by default).

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This Line was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "tor_version=" version_number NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The Tor version of the Tor process controlled by the generator.

      This Line was added in version 1.5.0 of this specification.

    KeyValue NL

      [Zero or more times.]

      There MUST NOT be multiple KeyValue header Lines with the same key.
      If there are, the parser SHOULD choose an arbitrary Line.

      If a parser does not recognize a Keyword in a KeyValue Line, it
      MUST be ignored.

      Future format versions may include additional KeyValue header Lines.
      Additional header Lines will be accompanied by a minor version
      increment.

      Implementations MAY add additional header Lines as needed. This
      specification SHOULD be updated to avoid conflicting meanings for
      the same header keys.

      Parsers MUST NOT rely on the order of these additional Lines.

      Additional header Lines MUST NOT use any keywords specified in the
      relay measurements format.
      If there are, the parser MAY ignore conflicting keywords.

    Terminator NL

      [Zero or one time.]

      The Header List section ends with a Terminator.

      In version 1.0.0, Header List ends when the first relay bandwidth
      is found conforming to the next section.

      Implementations of version 1.1.0 and later SHOULD use a 5-character
      terminator.

      Tor 0.4.0.1-alpha and later look for a 5-character terminator,
      or the first relay bandwidth line. sbws versions 0.1.0 to 1.0.2
      used a 4-character terminator, this bug was fixed in 1.0.3.

2.3. Relay Line format

  It consists of zero or more RelayLines containing relay ids and
  bandwidths. The relays and their KeyValues are in arbitrary order.

  There MUST NOT be multiple KeyValue pairs with the same key in the same
  RelayLine. If there are, the parser SHOULD choose an arbitrary Value.

  There MUST NOT be multiple RelayLines per relay identity (node_id or
  master_key_ed25519). If there are, parsers SHOULD issue a warning.
  Parers MAY reject the file, choose an arbitrary RelayLine, or ignore
  both RelayLines.

  If a parser does not recognize any extra material in a RelayLine,
  the extra material MUST be ignored.

  Each RelayLine includes the following KeyValue pairs:

    "node_id=" hexdigest

      [Exactly once.]

      The fingerprint for the relay's RSA identity key.

      Note: In bandwidth files read by Tor versions earlier than
            0.3.4.1-alpha, node_id MUST NOT be at the end of the Line.
            These authority versions are no longer supported.

      Current Tor versions ignore master_key_ed25519, so node_id MUST be
      present in each relay Line.

      Implementations of version 1.1.0 and later SHOULD include both node_id
      and master_key_ed25519. Parsers SHOULD accept Lines that contain at
      least one of them.

    "master_key_ed25519=" MasterKey

      [Zero or one time.]

      The relays's master Ed25519 key, base64 encoded,
      without trailing "="s, to avoid ambiguity with KeyValue "="
      character.

      This KeyValue pair SHOULD be present, see the note under node_id.

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.

    "bw=" Bandwidth

      [Exactly once.]

      The bandwidth of this relay in kilobytes per second.

      No Zero Bandwidths:
      Tor accepts zero bandwidths, but they trigger bugs in older Tor
      implementations. Therefore, implementations SHOULD NOT produce zero
      bandwidths. Instead, they SHOULD use one as their minimum bandwidth.
      If there are zero bandwidths, the parser MAY ignore them.

      Bandwidth Aggregation:
      Multiple measurements can be aggregated using an averaging scheme,
      such as a mean, median, or decaying average.

      Bandwidth Scaling:
      Torflow scales bandwidths to kilobytes per second. Other
      implementations SHOULD use kilobytes per second for their initial
      bandwidth scaling.

      If different implementations or configurations are used in votes for
      the same network, their measurements MAY need further scaling. See
      Appendix B for information about scaling, and one possible scaling
      method.

      MaxAdvertisedBandwidth:
      Bandwidth generators MUST limit the relays' measured bandwidth based
      on the MaxAdvertisedBadwidth.
      A relay's MaxAdvertisedBandwidth limits the bandwidth-avg in its
      descriptor. bandwidth-avg is the minimum of MaxAdvertisedBandwidth,
      BandwidthRate, RelayBandwidthRate, BandwidthBurst, and
      RelayBandwidthBurst.
      Therefore, generators MUST limit a relay's measured bandwidth to its
      descriptor's bandwidth-avg. This limit needs to be implemented in the
      generator, because generators may scale consensus weights before
      sending them to Tor.
      Generators SHOULD NOT limit measured bandwidths based on descriptors'
      bandwidth-observed, because that penalises new relays.

      sbws limits the relay's measured bandwidth to the bandwidth-avg
      advertised.

      Torflow partitions relays based on their bandwidth. For unmeasured
      relays, Torflow uses the minimum of all descriptor bandwidths,
      including bandwidth-avg (MaxAdvertisedBandwidth) and
      bandwidth-observed. Then Torflow measures the relays in each partition
      against each other, which implicitly limits a relay's measured
      bandwidth to the bandwidths of similar relays.

      Torflow also generates consensus weights based on the ratio between the
      measured bandwidth and the minimum of all descriptor bandwidths (at the
      time of the measurement). So when an operator reduces the
      MaxAdvertisedBandwidth for a relay, Torflow reduces that relay's
      measured bandwidth.

    KeyValue

      [Zero or more times.]

      Future format versions may include additional KeyValue pairs on a
      RelayLine.
      Additional KeyValue pairs will be accompanied by a minor version
      increment.

      Implementations MAY add additional relay KeyValue pairs as needed.
      This specification SHOULD be updated to avoid conflicting meanings
      for the same Keywords.

      Parsers MUST NOT rely on the order of these additional KeyValue
      pairs.

      Additional KeyValue pairs MUST NOT use any keywords specified in the
      header format.
      If there are, the parser MAY ignore conflicting keywords.

2.4. Implementation details

2.4.1. Writing bandwidth files atomically

  To avoid inconsistent reads, implementations SHOULD write bandwidth files
  atomically. If the file is transferred from another host, it SHOULD be
  written to a temporary path, then renamed to the V3BandwidthsFile path.

  sbws versions 0.7.0 and later write the bandwidth file to an archival
  location, create a temporary symlink to that location, then atomically rename
  the symlink
  to the configured V3BandwidthsFile path.

  Torflow does not write bandwidth files atomically.

2.4.2. Additional KeyValue pair definitions

  KeyValue pairs in RelayLines that current implementations generate.

2.4.2.1. Simple Bandwidth Scanner

  sbws RelayLines contain these keys:

    "node_id=" hexdigest

      As above.

    "bw=" Bandwidth

      As above.

    "nick=" nickname

      [Exactly once.]

      The relay nickname.

      Torflow also has a "nick=" KeyValue.

    "rtt=" Int

      [Zero or one time.]

      The Round Trip Time in milliseconds to obtain 1 byte of data.

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.
      It became optional in version 1.3.0 or 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "time=" DateTime

      [Exactly once.]

      The date and time timestamp in ISO 8601 format and UTC time zone
      when the last bandwidth was obtained.

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.1.0 of this specification.
      The Torflow equivalent is "measured_at=".

    "success=" Int

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of times that the bandwidth measurements for this relay were
      successful.

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "relay_recent_measurements_excluded_near_count=" Int

      [Zero or one time.]

      When all of a relay's recent successful measurements were performed in

      excluded. This KeyValue contains the number of recent successful
      measurements for the relay that were ignored for this reason.

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "relay_recent_measurements_excluded_old_count=" Int

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of successful measurements for this relay that are too old

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "recent_measurements_excluded_few_count=" Int

      [Zero or one time.]

      The number of successful measurements for this relay that were ignored
      because the relay did not have enough successful measurements (fewer
      than 2, by default).

      Excludes measurements that are already counted in
      relay_recent_measurements_excluded_near_count or
      relay_recent_measurements_excluded_old_count.

      (See the note in section 1.4, version 1.4.0, about excluded relays.)

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "under_min_report=" bool

      [Zero or one time.]

      If the value is 1, there are not enough eligible relays in the
      bandwidth file, and Tor bandwidth authorities MAY NOT vote on this
      relay. (Current Tor versions do not change their behaviour based on
      the "under_min_report" key.)

      If the value is 0 or the KeyValue is not present, there are enough
      relays in the bandwidth file.

      Because Tor versions released before April 2019 (see section 1.4. for
      the full list of versions) ignore "vote=0", generator implementations
      MUST NOT change the bandwidths for under_min_report relays. Using the
      same bw value makes authorities that do not understand "vote=0"
      or "under_min_report=1" produce votes that don't change relay weights
      too much. It also avoids flapping when the reporting threshold is
      reached.

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "unmeasured=" bool

      [Zero or one time.]

      If the value is 1, this relay was not successfully measured and
      Tor bandwidth authorities MAY NOT vote on this relay.
      (Current Tor versions do not change their behaviour based on
      the "unmeasured" key.)

      If the value is 0 or the KeyValue is not present, this relay
      was successfully measured.

      Because Tor versions released before April 2019 (see section 1.4. for
      the full list of versions) ignore "vote=0", generator implementations
      MUST set "bw=1" for unmeasured relays. Using the minimum bw value
      makes authorities that do not understand "vote=0" or "unmeasured=1"
      produce votes that don't change relay weights too much.

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

    "vote=" bool

      [Zero or one time.]

      If the value is 0, Tor directory authorities SHOULD ignore the relay's
      entry in the bandwidth file. They SHOULD vote for the relay the same
      way they would vote for a relay that is not present in the file.

      This MAY be the case when this relay was not successfully measured but
      it is included in the Bandwidth File, to diagnose why they were not
      measured.

      If the value is 1 or the KeyValue is not present, Tor directory
      authorities MUST use the relay's bw value in any votes for that relay.

      Implementations MUST also set "bw=1" for unmeasured relays.
      But they MUST NOT change the bw for under_min_report relays.
      (See the explanations under "unmeasured" and "under_min_report"
      for more details.)

      This KeyValue was added in version 1.4.0 of this specification.

B. Scaling bandwidths

B.1. Scaling requirements

  Tor accepts zero bandwidths, but they trigger bugs in older Tor
  implementations. Therefore, scaling methods SHOULD perform the
  following checks:
   * If the total bandwidth is zero, all relays should be given equal
   bandwidths.
   * If the scaled bandwidth is zero, it should be rounded up to one.

  Initial experiments indicate that scaling may not be needed for
  torflow and sbws, because their measured bandwidths are similar
  enough already.

B.2. A linear scaling method

  If scaling is required, here is a simple linear bandwith scaling
  method, which ensures that all bandwidth votes contain approximately
  the same total bandwidth:

  1. Calculate the relay quota by dividing the total measured bandwidth
     in all votes, by the number of relays with measured bandwidth
     votes. In the public tor network, this is approximately 7500 as of
     April 2018. The quota should be a consensus parameter, so it can be
     adjusted for all generators on the network.

  2. Calculate a vote quota by multiplying the relay quota by the number
     of relays this bandwidth authority has measured
     bandwidths for.

  3. Calculate a scaling factor by dividing the vote quota by the
     total unscaled measured bandwidth in this bandwidth
     authority's upcoming vote.

  4. Multiply each unscaled measured bandwidth by the scaling
     factor.

  Now, the total scaled bandwidth in the upcoming vote is
  approximately equal to the quota.

B.3. Quota changes

  If all generators are using scaling, the quota can be gradually
  reduced or increased as needed. Smaller quotas decrease the size
  of uncompressed consensuses, and may decrease the size of
  consensus diffs and compressed consensuses. But if the relay
  quota is too small, some relays may be over- or under-weighted.

B.4. Torflow aggreation

  Torflow implements two methods to compute the bandwidth values from the
  (stream) bandwidth measurements: with and without PID control feedback.
  The method described here is without PID control (see Torflow
  specification, section 2.2).

  In the following sections, the relays' measured bandwidth refer to the
  ones that this bandwidth authority has measured for the relays that
  would be included in the next bandwidth authority's upcoming vote.

  1. Calculate the filtered bandwidth for each relay:
    - choose the relay's measurements (`bw_j`) that are equal or greater
      than the mean of the measurements for this relay
    - calculate the mean of those measurements

    In pseudocode:

      bw_filt_i = mean(max(mean(bw_j), bw_j))

  2. Calculate network averages:
    - calculate the filtered average by dividing the sum of all the
      relays' filtered bandwidth by the number of relays that have been
      measured (`n`), ie, calculate the mean average of the relays'
      filtered bandwidth.
    - calculate the stream average by dividing the sum of all the
      relays' filtered bandwidth by the number of relays that have been
      measured (`n`), ie, calculate the mean average or the relays'
     measured bandwidth.

     In pseudocode:

       bw_avg_filt_ = bw_filt_i / n
       bw_avg_strm = bw_i / n

  3. Calculate ratios for each relay:
    - calculate the filtered ratio by dividing each relay filtered
      bandwidth by the filtered average
    - calculate the stream ratio by dividing each relay measured
      bandwidth by the stream average

    In pseudocode:

      r_filt_i = bw_filt_i / bw_avg_filt
      r_strm_i = bw_i / bw_avg_strm

  4. Calculate the final ratio for each relay:
    The final ratio is the larger between the filtered bandwidth and the
    stream bandwidth.

    In pseudocode:

      r_i = max(r_filt_i, r_strm_i)

  5. Calculate the scaled bandwidth for each relay:
    The most recent descriptor observed bandwidth (`bw_obs_i`) is
    multiplied by the ratio

    In pseudocode:

      bw_new_i = r_i * bw_obs_i

    <<In this way, the resulting network status consensus bandwidth
    values are effectively re-weighted proportional to how much faster
    the node was as compared to the rest of the network.>>
