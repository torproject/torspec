Title: Safe cookie authentication for Tor controllers
Author: Robert Ransom
Created: 2012-02-04
Status: Open

Overview:

  Not long ago, all Tor controllers which automatically attempted
  'cookie authentication' were vulnerable to an information-disclosure
  attack.  (See https://bugs.torproject.org/4303 for slightly more
  information.)

  Now, some Tor controllers which automatically attempt cookie
  authentication are only vulnerable to an information-disclosure
  attack on any 32-byte files they can read.  But the Ed25519
  signature scheme (among other cryptosystems) has 32-byte secret
  keys, and we would like to not worry about Tor controllers leaking
  our secret keys to whatever can listen on what the controller thinks
  is Tor's control port.

  Additionally, we would like to not have to remodel Tor's innards and
  rewrite all of our Tor controllers to use TLS on Tor's control port
  this week (or deal with the many design issues which that would
  raise).

Design:

+  The server will reject this command with error code 512, then close
+  the connection, if Tor is not using the file specified in the
+  AuthCookieFile argument as a controller authentication cookie file.
+
+  If the server accepts the command, the server reply format is:
+    "250-AUTHCHALLENGE"
+            SP "CLIENTRESPONSE=" 64*64HEXDIG
+            SP "SERVERCHALLENGE=" 2*HEXDIG

+
+  The CLIENTCHALLENGE, CLIENTRESPONSE, and SERVERCHALLENGE values are
+  encoded/decoded in the same way as the argument passed to the
+  AUTHENTICATE command.
+
+  The CLIENTRESPONSE value is computed as:
+    HMAC-SHA256(HMAC-SHA256("Tor server-to-controller cookie authenticator",
+                            CookieString)
+                ClientChallengeString)
+  (with the HMAC key as its first argument)
+
+  After a controller sends a successful AUTHCHALLENGE command, the
+  next command sent on the connection must be an AUTHENTICATE command,
+  and the only authentication string which that AUTHENTICATE command
+  will accept is:
+    HMAC-SHA256(HMAC-SHA256("Tor controller-to-server cookie authenticator",

Rationale:

  The weird inner HMAC was meant to ensure that whatever impersonates
  Tor's control port cannot even abuse a secret key meant to be used
  with HMAC-SHA256.

  Then I added the server-to-controller challenge-response
  authentication step, to ensure that the server can only use a
  controller as an HMAC oracle if it already knows the contents of the
  cookie file.  Now, the inner HMAC is just a not-very-efficient way
  to keep controllers from using the server as an oracle for its own
  challenges (it could be replaced with a hash function).
