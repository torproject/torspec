1. Introduction

   As IPv4 address space becomes scarce, ISPs and organizations will deploy
   IPv6 in their networks. Right now, Tor clients connect to guards using
   IPv4 connectivity by default.

   When networks first transition to IPv6, both IPv4 and IPv6 will be enabled
   on most networks in a so-called "dual-stack" configuration. This is to not
   break existing IPv4-only applications while enabling IPv6 connectivity.
   However, IPv6 connectivity may be unreliable and clients should be able
   to connect to the guard using the most reliable technology, whether IPv4
   or IPv6.

   In ticket #27490, we introduced the option ClientAutoIPv6ORPort which
   lets a client randomly choose between IPv4 or IPv6. However, this
   random decision does not take into account unreliable connectivity
   or falling back to the competing IP version should one be unreliable
   or unavailable.

   One way to select between IPv4 and IPv6 on a dual-stack network is a
   so-called "Happy Eyeballs" algorithm as per RFC 8305. In one, a client
   attempts an IP family, whether IPv4 or IPv6. Should it work, the client
   sticks with the working IP family. Otherwise, the client attempts the
   opposing version. This means if a dual-stack client has both IPv4 and
   IPv6, and IPv6 is unreliable, the client uses IPv4, and vice versa.

   In Proposal 299, we have attempted a IP fallback mechanism using failure
   counters and preferring IPv4 and IPv6 based on the state of the counters.
   However, Prop299 was not standard Happy Eyeballs and an alternative,
   standards-compliant proposal was requested in [P299-TRAC] to avoid issues
   from complexity caused by randomness.

   This proposal describes a Tor implementation of Happy Eyeballs and is
   intended as a successor to Proposal 299.

2. Address Selection

   To be able to handle Happy Eyeballs in Tor, we will need to modify the
   data structures used for connections to guards, namely the extend info
   structure.

   The extend info structure should contain both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.
   This will allow us to try IPv4 and the IPv6 addresses should both be
   available on a relay and the client is dual-stack.

   When parsing relay descriptors and filling in the extend info data
   structure, we need to fill in both the IPv4 and IPv6 address if they both
   are available. If only one family is available for a relay (IPv4 or IPv6),
   we should fill in the address for available family and leave the opposing
   family null.

3. Connecting To A Relay

   When a client connects to a guard using an extend info data structure, we
   should first check if there is an existing authenticated connection. If
   there is, we should use it.

   If there is no existing authenticated connection for an extend info, we
   should attempt to connect using the first available, allowed, and preferred
   address. At the time of writing, this is IPv4.

   We should also schedule a timer for connecting using the other address
   should one be available and allowed, and the first attempted version
   fails. This should be higher than most client's successful TLS
   authentication time. I propose that the timer is 15 seconds. The reason
   for this is to accommodate high-latency connections such as dial-up and
   satellite.

4. Handling Connection Successes And Failures

   Should a connection to a guard succeed and is authenticated via TLS, we
   can then use the connection. In this case, we should cancel all other
   connection timers and in-progress connections. Cancelling the timers is
   so we don't attempt new unnecessary connections when our existing
   connection is successful, preventing denial-of-service risks.

   However, if we fail all available and allowed connections, we should tell
   the rest of Tor that the connection has failed. This is so we can attempt
   another guard relay.

5. Acknowledgments

   Thank you so much to teor for the discussion of the happy eyeballs proposal.
   I wouldn't have been able to do this has it not been for your help.
