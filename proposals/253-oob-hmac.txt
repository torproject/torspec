Title: Out of Band Circuit HMACs
Authors: Mike Perry
Created: 01 September 2015
Status: Draft


0. Motivation


It is currently possible for Guard nodes (and MITM adversaries that
steal their identity keys) to perform a "tagging" attack to influence
circuit construction and resulting relay usage[1].

Because Tor uses AES as a stream cipher, malicious or intercepted Guard
nodes can simply XOR a unique identifier into the circuit cipherstream
during circuit setup and usage. If this identifier is not removed by a
colluding exit (either by performing another XOR, or making use of known
plaintext regions of a cell to directly extract a complete side-channel
value), then the circuit will fail. In this way, malicious or
intercepted Guard nodes can ensure that all client traffic is directed
only to colluding exit nodes, who can observe the destinations and
deanonymize users.

Most code paths in the Tor relay source code will emit loud warnings for
the most obvious instances circuit failure caused by this attack.
However, it is very difficult to ensure that all such error conditions
are properly covered such that warnings will be emitted.

This proposal aims to provide a mechanism to ensure that tagging and
related malleability attacks are cryptographically detectable when they
happen.


1. Overview

Since Tor Relays are already storing a running hash of all data
transmitted on their circuits (via the or_circuit_t::n_digest and
or_circuit_t::p_digest properties), it is possible to compute an
out-of-band HMAC on circuit data, and verify that it is as expected.

This proposal first defines an OOB_HMAC primitive that can be included
standalone in a new relay cell command type, and additionally in other
cell types.

Use of the standalone relay cell command serves to ensure that circuits
that are successfully built and used were not manipulated at a previous
point.

By altering the RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED and CELL_DESTROY cells to also
include the OOB_HMAC information, it is similarly possible to detect
alteration of circuit contents that cause failures before the point of
usage.


2. The OOB_HMAC primitive

The OOB_HMAC primitive uses the existing rolling hashes present in
or_circuit_t to provide a Tor OP (aka client) with the hash history of
the traffic that a given relay has seen it so far.

Note that to avoid storing an additional 64 bytes of SHA256 digest for
every circuit at every relay, we use SHA1 for the hash logs, since the
circuits are already storing SHA1 hashes. It's not immediately clear how
to upgrade the existing SHA1 digests to SHA256 with the current circuit
protocol, either, since matching hash algorithms are essential to the
'recognized' relay cell forwarding behavior. The version field exists
primarily for this reason, should the rolling circuit hashes ever
upgrade to SHA256.

The OOB_HMAC primitive is specified in Trunnel as follows:

     struct oob_hmac_body {
        /* Version of this section. Must be 1 */
        u8 version;
       
        /* SHA1 hash of all client-originating data on this circuit
           (obtained from or_circuit_t::n_digest). */
        u8 client_hash_log[20];
        /* Number of cells processed in this hash, mod 2^32. Used
           to spot-check hash position */
        u32 client_cell_count;
        
        /* SHA1 hash of all server-originating data on this circuit
           (obtained from or_circuit_t::p_digest). */
        u8 server_hash_log[20];
        /* Number of cells processed in this hash, mod 2^32. Used
           to spot-check hash position.
           XXX: Technically the server-side is not needed. */
        u32 server_cell_count;

        /* HMAC-SHA-256 of the entire cell contents up to this point,
           using or_circuit_t::p_crypto as the hmac key.
           XXX: Should we use a KDF here instead of p_crypto directly? */   
        u8 cell_hmac_256[32];
     };


3. Usage of OOB_HMAC

The OOB_HMAC body will be included in three places:

 1. In a new relay cell command RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_SEND, which is sent in
    response to a client-originating RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET on stream 0.
 2. In CELL_DESTROY, immediately after the error code
 3. In RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED, immediately after the CELL_DESTROY
    contents

3.1. RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET/SEND relay commands

Clients should use leaky-pipe topology to send RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET to
the second-to-last node (typically the middle node) in the circuit at
three points during circuit construction and usage:

  1. Immediately after the last RELAY_EARLY cell is sent
  2. Upon any stream detachment, timeout, or failure.
  3. Upon any OP-initiated circuit teardown (including timed-out partially
     built circuits).

We use RELAY_EARLY as the point at which to send these cells to avoid
leaking the path length to the middle hop.

3.2. Alteration of CELL_DESTROY and RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED

In order to provide an HMAC even when a circuit is torn down before use
due to failure, the behavior for generating and handling CELL_DESTROY
and RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED should be modified as follows:

Whenever an OR sends a CELL_DESTROY for a circuit towards the OP, if
that circuit was already properly established, the OR should include the
contents of oob_hmac_body immediately after the reason field. The HMAC
must cover the error code from CELL_DESTROY.

Upon receipt of a CELL_DESTROY, and in any other case where an OR would
generate a RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED due to error, a conformant relay
would include the CELL_DESTROY oob_hmac_body, as well as its own
locally created oob_hmac_body. The locally created oob_hmac_body must
cover the entire payload contents of RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED, including 
the error code and the CELL_DESTROY oob_hmac_body.

Here is a new Trunnel specification for RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED:

     struct relay_command_truncated {
        /* Error code */
        u8 error_code;

        /* Number of oob_hmacs. Must be 0, 1, or 2 */
        u8 num_hmac;

        /* If there are 2 hmacs, the first one is from the CELL_DESTROY,
           and the second one is from the truncating relay. If num_hmac
           is 0, then this came from a relay without support for
           oob_hmac. */
        struct oob_hmac_body[num_hmac];
     };

The usage of a strong HMAC to cover the entire CELL_DESTROY contents
also allows an OP to properly authenticate the reason a remote node
needed to close a circuit, without relying on the previous hop to be
honest about it.


4. Ensuring proper ordering with respect to hashes

4.1. RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET/SEND

The in-order delivery guarantee of circuits will mean that the incoming
hashes will match upon receipt of the RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_SEND cell, but
any outgoing traffic the OP sent since RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET will
not have been seen by the responding OR.

Therefore, immediately upon sending a RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET, the OP
must record and store its current outgoing hash state for that circuit,
until the RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_SEND arrives, and use that stored hash
value for comparison against the oob_hmac_body's client_hash_log field.

The server_hash_log should be checked against the corresponding
crypt_path_t entry in origin_circuit_t for the relay that the command
was sent to.

4.2. RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED

Since RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED may be sent in response to any error
condition generated by a cell in either direction, the OP must check
that its local cell counts match those present in the oob_hmac_body for
that hop.

If the counts do not match, the OP may generate a RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET
to the hop that sent RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED, prior to tearing down the
circuit.

4.3. CELL_DESTROY

If the cell counts of the destroy cell's oob_hmac_body do not match what
the client sent for that hop, unfortunately that hash must be discarded.
Otherwise, it may be checked against values held from before processing
the RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED envelope.


5. Security concerns and mitigations

5.1. Silent circuit failure attacks

The primary way to game this oob-hmac is to omit or block cells
containing HMACs from reaching the OP, or otherwise tear down circuits
before responses arrive with proof of tampering.

If a large fraction of circuits somehow fail without any
RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED oob_hmac_body payloads present, and without any
responses to RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET requests, the user should be alerted
of this fact as well.

This rate of silent circuit failure should be kept as an additional,
separate per-Guard Path Bias statistic, and the user should be warned if
this failure rate exceeds some (low) threshold for circuits containing
relays that should have supported this proposal.

5.2. Malicious/colluding middle nodes

If the adversary is prevented from causing silent circuit failure
without the client being able to notice and react, their next available
vector is to ensure that circuits are only built to middle nodes that
are malicious and colluding with them (or that do not support this
proposal), so that they may lie about the proper hash values that they
see (or omit them).

Right now, the current path bias code also does not count circuit
failures to the middle hop as circuit attempts. This was done to reduce
the effect of ambient circuit failure on the path bias accounting (since
an average ambient circuit failure of X per-hop causes the total circuit
failure middle+exit circuits to be 2X). Unfortunately, not counting
middle hop failure allows the adversary to only allow circuits to
colluding middle hops to complete, so that they may lie about their hash
logs. All failed circuits to non-colluding middle nodes could be torn
down before RELAY_COMMAND_TRUNCATED is sent.

For this reason, the per-Guard Path Bias counts should be augmented to
additionally track middle-node-only failure as a separate statistic as
well, and the user should be warned if middle-node failure drops below a
similar threshold as the current end-to-end failure.

5.3. Side channel issues, mitigations, and limitations

Unfortunately, leaking information about circuit usage to the middle
node prevents us from sending RELAY_COMMAND_HMAC_GET cells at more
optimal points in circuit usage (such as immediately upon open,
immediately after stream usage, etc).

As such, we are limited to waiting until RELAY_EARLY cells stop being
sent. It is debatable if we should send hashes periodically (perhaps
with windowing information updates?) instead.


6. Alternatives

A handful of alternatives to this proposal have already been discussed,
but have been dismissed for various reasons. Per-hop cell HMACs were
ruled out because they will leak the total path length, as well as the
current hop's position in the circuit.

Wide-block ciphers have been discussed, which would provide the property
that attempts to alter a cell at a previous hop would render it
completely corrupted upon its final destination, thus preventing
untagging and recovery, even by a colluding malicious peer.

Unfortunately, performance analysis of modern provably secure versions
of wide-block ciphers has shown them to be at least 10X slower than
AES-NI[2].
