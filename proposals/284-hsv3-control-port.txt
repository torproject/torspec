Title: Hidden Service v3 Control Port
Author: David Goulet
Created: 02-November-2017
Status: Finished

1. Summary

   This document extends the hidden service control port events and commands
   to version 3 (rend-spec-v3.txt).

   No command nor events are newly added in this document, it only desribes
   how the current commands and events are extended to support v3.

2. Format

   The formatting of this document follows section 2 of control-spec.txt. It
   is split in two sections, the Commands and the Events for hidden service
   version 3.

   We define the alphabet of a Base64 encoded value to be:

      Base64Character = "A"-"Z" / "a"-"z" / "0"-"9" / "+" / "/"

   For a command or event, if nothing is mentionned, the behavior doesn't
   change from the control port specification.

3. Specification:

3.1. Commands

   As specified in the control specification, all commands are
   case-insensitive but the keywords are case-sensitive.

3.1.1. GETINFO

   Hidden service commands are:

     "hs/client/desc/id/<ADDR>"
       The <ADDR> can be a v3 address without the ".onion" part. The rest is
       as is.

     "hs/service/desc/id/<ADDR>"
       The <ADDR> can be a v3 address without the ".onion" part. The rest is
       as is.

     "onions/{current,detached}"
       No change. This command can support v3 hidden service without changes
       returning v3 address(es).

3.1.2. HSFETCH

   The syntax of this command supports both an HSAddress or a versionned
   descriptor ID. However, for descriptor ID, version 3 doesn't have the same
   concept as v2 so, for v3 the descriptor ID is the blinded key of a
   descriptor which is used as an index to query the HSDir:

   The syntax becomes:
     "HSFETCH" SP (HSAddress / "v" Version "-" DescId)
               *[SP "SERVER=" Server] CRLF

     HSAddress = (16*Base32Character / 56*Base32Character)
     Version = "2" / "3"
     DescId = (32*Base32Character / 32*Base64Character)
     Server = LongName

   The "HSAddress" key is extended to accept 56 base32 characters which is the
   format of a version 3 onion address.

   The "DescId" of the form 32*Base64Character is the descriptor blinded key
   used as an index to query the directory. It can only be used with
   "Version=3".

3.1.5. HSPOST

   To support version 3, the command needs an extra parameter that is the
   onion address of the given descriptor. With v2, the address could have been
   deduced from the given descriptor but with v3, this is not possible.  In
   order to fire up the HS_DESC event correctly, we need the address so the
   request can be linked on the control port.

   Furthermore, the given descriptor will be validated with the given address
   and an error will be returned if they are not matching.

   The syntax becomes:

     "+HSPOST" *[SP "SERVER=" Server] [SP "HSADDRESS=" HSAddress]
               CRLF Descriptor CRLF "." CRLF

     HSAddress = 56*Base32Character

   The "HSAddress" key is optional and only applies for v3 descriptors. A 513
   error is returned if used with v2.

3.1.3. ADD_ONION

   For this command to support version 3, new values are added but the syntax
   is unchanged:

     "ADD_ONION" SP KeyType ":" KeyBlob
                 [SP "Flags=" Flag *("," Flag)]
                 1*(SP "Port=" VirtPort ["," Target])
                 *(SP "ClientAuth=" ClientName [":" ClientBlob]) CRLF

   New "KeyType" value to "ED25519-V3" which identifies the key type to be a
   v3 ed25519 key.

   With the KeyType == "ED25519-V3", the "KeyBlob" should be a base64 encoded
   ed25519 private key.

   The "NEW:BEST" option will still return a version 2 address as long as the
   HiddenServiceVersion torrc option default is 2. To ask for a new v3 key,
   this should be used: "NEW:ED25519-V3".

   Because client authentication is not yet implemented, the "ClientAuth"
   field is ignored as well as "Flags=BasicAuth". A 513 error is returned if
   "ClientAuth" is used with an ED25519-V3 key type.

3.1.4. DEL_ONION

   The syntax of this command is:

     "DEL_ONION" SP ServiceID CRLF

     ServiceID = The Onion Service address without the trailing ".onion"
                 suffix

   The "ServiceID" can simply be a v3 address. Nothing else changes.

3.2. Events

3.2.1. HS_DESC

   For this event to support vesrion 3, one optional field and new
   values are added:

     "650" SP "HS_DESC" SP Action SP HSAddress SP AuthType SP HsDir
           [SP DescriptorID] [SP "REASON=" Reason] [SP "REPLICA=" Replica]
           [SP "HSDIR_INDEX=" HSDirIndex]

     Action =  "REQUESTED" / "UPLOAD" / "RECEIVED" / "UPLOADED" / "IGNORE" /
               "FAILED" / "CREATED"
     HSAddress = 16*Base32Character / 56*Base32Character / "UNKNOWN"
     AuthType = "NO_AUTH" / "BASIC_AUTH" / "STEALTH_AUTH" / "UNKNOWN"
     HsDir = LongName / Fingerprint / "UNKNOWN"
     DescriptorID = 32*Base32Character / 43*Base64Character
     Reason = "BAD_DESC" / "QUERY_REJECTED" / "UPLOAD_REJECTED" / "NOT_FOUND" /
              "UNEXPECTED" / "QUERY_NO_HSDIR"
     Replica = 1*DIGIT
     HSDirIndex = 64*HEXDIG

   The "HSDIR_INDEX=" is an optional field that is only for version 3 which
   contains the computed index of the HsDir the descriptor was uploaded to or
   fetched from.

   The "HSAddress" key is extended to accept 56 base32 characters which is the
   format of a version 3 onion address.

   The "DescriptorID" key is extended to accept 43 base64 characters which is
   the descriptor blinded key used for the index value at the "HsDir".

   The "REPLICA=" field is not used for the "CREATED" event because v3 doesn't
   use the replica number in the descriptor ID computation.

   Because client authentication is not yet implemented, the "AuthType" field
   is always "NO_AUTH".

3.2.2. HS_DESC_CONTENT

   For this event to support version 3, new values are added but the syntax is
   unchanged:

     "650" "+" "HS_DESC_CONTENT" SP HSAddress SP DescId SP HsDir CRLF
                Descriptor CRLF "." CRLF "650" SP "OK" CRLF

     HSAddress = 16*Base32Character / 56*Base32Character / "UNKNOWN"
     DescId = 32*Base32Character / 32*Base64Character
     HsDir = LongName / "UNKNOWN"
     Descriptor = The text of the descriptor formatted as specified in
                  rend-spec-v3.txt section 2.4 or empty string on failure.

   The "HSAddress" key is extended to accept 56 base32 characters which is the
   format of a version 3 onion address.

   The "DescriptorID" key is extended to accept 32 base64 characters which is
   the descriptor blinded key used for the index value at the "HsDir".

3.2.3 CIRC and CIRC_MINOR

   These circuit events have an optional field named "REND_QUERY" which takes
   an "HSAddress". This field is extended to support v3 address:

      HSAddress = 16*Base32Character / 56*Base32Character / "UNKNOWN"
