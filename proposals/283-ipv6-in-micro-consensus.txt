Title: Move IPv6 ORPorts from microdescriptors to the microdesc consensus
Author: Tim Wilson-Brown (teor)
Created: 18-Oct-2017
Status: Open
Target: 0.3.3.x

1. Summary

   Moving IPv6 ORPorts from microdescs to the microdesc consensus will make
   it easier for IPv6 clients to bootstrap and select reachable guards.

   Since consensus method 14, authorities have voted for IPv6 address/port
   pairs (ORPorts) in "a" lines. Unreachable IPv6 ORPorts are dropped from the
   full consensus. But for clients that use microdescriptors (the default),
   IPv6 ORPorts are placed in microdescriptors. So these clients can only tell
   if an IPv6 ORPort is unreachable when a majority of voting authorities
   mark the relay as not Running.

   This proposal puts reachable relay IPv6 ORPorts in an "a" line in the
   microdesc consensus. This allows clients to discover unreachable IPv6
   ORPorts, even if a minority of voting authorities set
   AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1.

2. Proposal

   We add two new consensus methods, here represented as M and N (M < N), to
   be allocated when this proposal's implementation is merged. These consensus
   methods move IPv6 ORPorts from microdescs to the microdesc consensus.

   We use two different methods because this allows us to modify client code
   based on each method. Also, if a bug is discovered in one of the methods,
   authorities can be patched to stop voting for it, and then we can implement
   a fix in a later method.

2.1. Add Reachable IPv6 ORPorts to the Microdesc Consensus

   We specify that microdescriptor consensuses created with methods M or later
   contain reachable IPv6 ORPorts.

2.2. Remove IPv6 ORPorts from Microdescriptors

   We specify that microdescriptors created with methods N or later do not
   contain any IPv6 ORPorts.

3. Retaining Existing Behaviour

   The following existing behaviour will be retained:

3.1. Authority IPv6 Reachability

   Only authorities configured with AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1 will test
   IPv6 ORPort reachability, and vote for IPv6 ORPorts.

   This means that:
   * if no voting authorities set AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1, there will be
     no IPv6 ORPorts in the consensus,
   * if a minority of voting authorities set AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1,
     unreachable IPv6 ORPort lines will be dropped from the consensus, but the
     relay will still be listed as Running,
   * if a majority of voting authorities set AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1,
     relays with unreachable IPv6 ORPorts will be dropped from the consensus.

   We will document this behaviour in the tor manual page, see #23870.

3.2. Full Consensus IPv6 ORPorts

   The full consensus will continue to contain reachable IPv6 ORPorts.

3.3. Clients that use Full Descriptors

   Tor clients that use full descriptors already ignore unreachable IPv6
   ORPorts, and have done so since at least 0.2.8.x.

4. Impact and Related Changes

4.1. Directory Authority Configuration

   We will work to get a super-majority (75%) of authorities checking relay
   IPv6 reachability, to avoid Running-flag flapping. To do this, authorities
   need to get IPv6 connectivity, and set AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 1.

4.2. Relays and Bridges

   Tor relays and bridges do not currently use IPv6 ORPorts from the
   consensus.

   We expect that 2/3 of authorities will be voting for consensus method N
   before future Tor relay or bridge versions use IPv6 ORPorts from the
   consensus.

4.3. Clients

4.3.1. Legacy Clients

4.3.1.1. IPv6 ORPort Circuits

   Tor clients on versions 0.2.8.x to 0.3.2.x check directory documents for
   ORPorts in the following order:
     * descriptors (routerinfo, available if using bridges or full descriptors)
     * consensus (routerstatus)
     * microdescriptors (IPv6 ORPorts only)

   Their behaviour will be identical to the current behaviour for consensus
   methods M and earlier. When consensus method N is used, they will ignore
   unreachable IPv6 ORPorts without any code changes.

4.3.1.2. IPv6 ORPort Bootstrap

   Tor clients on versions 0.2.8.x and 0.2.9.x are currently unable to
   bootstrap over IPv6 only connections when using microdescriptors. This
   happens because the microdesc consensus does not contain IPv6 ORPorts.

   When consensus method M is used, they will be able to bootstrap over IPv6
   only connections using microdescriptors, without any code changes.

4.3.2. Future Clients

4.3.2.1. Ignoring IPv6 ORPorts in Microdescs

   Tor clients on versions 0.3.3.x and later will ignore unreachable IPv6
   ORPorts once consensus method M or later is in use. (See #23827.)

4.3.2.2. IPv6 ORPort Bootstrap

   If a bootstrapping IPv6-only client has a consensus made with method M or
   later, it should download microdescriptors from one of the IPv6 ORPorts in
   that consensus. Previously, IPv6-only clients would use fallback directory
   mirrors to download microdescs, because there were no IPv6 ORPorts in the
   microdesc consensus. (See #23827.)

4.3.2.3. Ignoring Addresses in Unused Directory Documents

   If a client doesn't use a particular directory document type for a node,
   it should ignore any addresses in that document type. (See #23975.)

5. Data Size

   This change removes 7-50 bytes from the microdescriptors of relays that
   have an IPv6 ORPort, and adds them to reachable IPv6 relays' microdesc
   consensus entries.

   As of October 2017, 600 relays (9%) have IPv6 ORPorts in the full
   consensus. Their "a" lines take up 19 KB, or 33 bytes each on average.
   The microdesc consensus is 1981 KB, so this represents about 1% of its
   uncompressed size.

   Most tor clients are already running 0.3.1.7, which implements consensus
   diffs. We expect that most directory mirrors will also implement consensus
   diffs by the time 2/3 of authorities are voting for consensus method M.

   So we expect that this change will have a minimal impact, which is made
   even smaller by compression and consensus diffs.

6. External Impacts

   We don't expect this change to impact Onionoo and similar projects, because
   they typically use the full consensus.

   Metrics doesn't currently graph IPv6 usage in Tor, but would like to in
   future.
