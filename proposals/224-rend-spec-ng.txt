-1. Draft notes

   This document describes a proposed design and specification for
   hidden services in Tor version 0.2.5.x or later. It's a replacement
   for the current rend-spec.txt, rewritten for clarity and for improved
   design.

   Look for the string "TODO" below: it describes gaps or uncertainties
   in the design.

   Change history:

       2013-11-29: Proposal first numbered. Some TODO and XXX items remain.

       2014-01-04: Clarify some unclear sections.

       2014-01-21: Fix a typo.

       2014-02-20: Move more things to the revised certificate format in the
           new updated proposal 220.

       2015-05-26: Fix two typos.


0. Hidden services: overview and preliminaries.

   Hidden services aim to provide responder anonymity for bidirectional
   stream-based communication on the Tor network. Unlike regular Tor
   connections, where the connection initiator receives anonymity but
   the responder does not, hidden services attempt to provide
   bidirectional anonymity.

   Other features include:

     * [TODO: WRITE ME once there have been some more drafts and we know
       what the summary should say.]

   Participants:

      Operator -- A person running a hidden service

      Host, "Server" -- The Tor software run by the operator to provide
         a hidden service.

      User -- A person contacting a hidden service.

      Client -- The Tor software running on the User's computer

      Hidden Service Directory (HSDir) -- A Tor node that hosts signed
        statements from hidden service hosts so that users can make
        contact with them.

      Introduction Point -- A Tor node that accepts connection requests
        for hidden services and anonymously relays those requests to the
        hidden service.

      Rendezvous Point -- A Tor node to which clients and servers
        connect and which relays traffic between them.



0.1. Improvements over previous versions.

   [TODO write me once there have been more drafts and we know what the
   summary should say.]

0.2. Notation and vocabulary

   Unless specified otherwise, all multi-octet integers are big-endian.

   We write sequences of bytes in two ways:

     1. A sequence of two-digit hexadecimal values in square brackets,
        as in [AB AD 1D EA].

     2. A string of characters enclosed in quotes, as in "Hello". The
        characters in these strings are encoded in their ascii
        representations; strings are NOT nul-terminated unless
        explicitly described as NUL terminated.

   We use the words "byte" and "octet" interchangeably.

   We use the vertical bar | to denote concatenation.

   We use INT_N(val) to denote the network (big-endian) encoding of the
   unsigned integer "val" in N bytes. For example, INT_4(1337) is [00 00
   05 39].

0.3. Cryptographic building blocks

   This specification uses the following cryptographic building blocks:

      * A pseudorandom number generator backed by a strong entropy source.
        The output of the PRNG should always be hashed before being posted on
        the network to avoid leaking raw PRNG bytes to the network
        (see [PRNG-REFS]).

      * A stream cipher STREAM(iv, k) where iv is a nonce of length
        S_IV_LEN bytes and k is a key of length S_KEY_LEN bytes.

      * A public key signature system SIGN_KEYGEN()->seckey, pubkey;
        SIGN_SIGN(seckey,msg)->sig; and SIGN_CHECK(pubkey, sig, msg) ->
        { "OK", "BAD" }; where secret keys are of length SIGN_SECKEY_LEN
        bytes, public keys are of length SIGN_PUBKEY_LEN bytes, and
        signatures are of length SIGN_SIG_LEN bytes.

        This signature system must also support key blinding operations
        as discussed in appendix [KEYBLIND] and in section [SUBCRED]:
        SIGN_BLIND_SECKEY(seckey, blind)->seckey2 and
        SIGN_BLIND_PUBKEY(pubkey, blind)->pubkey2 .

      * A public key agreement system "PK", providing
        PK_KEYGEN()->seckey, pubkey; PK_VALID(pubkey) -> {"OK", "BAD"};
        and PK_HANDSHAKE(seckey, pubkey)->output; where secret keys are
        of length PK_SECKEY_LEN bytes, public keys are of length
        PK_PUBKEY_LEN bytes, and the handshake produces outputs of
        length PK_OUTPUT_LEN bytes.

      * A cryptographic hash function H(d), which should be preimage and
        collision resistant. It produces hashes of length HASH_LEN
        bytes.

      * A cryptographic message authentication code MAC(key,msg) that
        produces outputs of length MAC_LEN bytes.

      * A key derivation function KDF(message, n) that outputs n bytes.

   As a first pass, I suggest:

      * Instantiate STREAM with AES256-CTR.

      * Instantiate SIGN with Ed25519 and the blinding protocol in
        [KEYBLIND].

      * Instantiate PK with Curve25519.

      * Instantiate H with SHA3-256.

      * Instantiate MAC(key=k, message=m) with H(k || m).

      * Instantiate KDF with SHAKE-256.

   For legacy purposes, we specify compatibility with older versions of
   the Tor introduction point and rendezvous point protocols. These used
   RSA1024, DH1024, AES128, and SHA1, as discussed in
   rend-spec.txt.

   As in [proposal 220], all signatures are generated not over strings
   themselves, but over those strings prefixed with a distinguishing
   value.

0.4. Protocol building blocks [BUILDING-BLOCKS]

   In sections below, we need to transmit the locations and identities
   of Tor nodes. We do so in the link identification format used by
   EXTEND2 cells in the Tor protocol.

         NSPEC      (Number of link specifiers)   [1 byte]
         NSPEC times:
           LSTYPE (Link specifier type)           [1 byte]
           LSLEN  (Link specifier length)         [1 byte]
           LSPEC  (Link specifier)                [LSLEN bytes]

   Link specifier types are as described in tor-spec.txt. Every set of
   link specifiers MUST include at minimum specifiers of type [00]
   (TLS-over-TCP, IPv4) and [02] (legacy node identity).

   We also incorporate Tor's circuit extension handshakes, as used in
   the CREATE2 and CREATED2 cells described in tor-spec.txt. In these
   handshakes, a client who knows a public key for a server sends a
   message and receives a message from that server. Once the exchange is
   done, the two parties have a shared set of forward-secure key
   material, and the client knows that nobody else shares that key
   material unless they control the secret key corresponding to the
   server's public key.

0.5. Assigned relay cell types

   These relay cell types are reserved for use in the hidden service
   protocol.

      32 -- RELAY_COMMAND_ESTABLISH_INTRO

            Sent from hidden service host to introduction point;
            establishes introduction point. Discussed in
            [REG_INTRO_POINT].

      33 -- RELAY_COMMAND_ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS

            Sent from client to rendezvous point; creates rendezvous
            point. Discussed in [EST_REND_POINT].

      34 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRODUCE1

            Sent from client to introduction point; requests
            introduction. Discussed in [SEND_INTRO1]

      35 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRODUCE2

            Sent from introduction point to hidden service host; requests
            introduction. Same format as INTRODUCE1. Discussed in
            [FMT_INTRO1] and [PROCESS_INTRO2]

      36 -- RELAY_COMMAND_RENDEZVOUS1

            Sent from hidden service host to rendezvous point;
            attempts to join host's circuit to
            client's circuit. Discussed in [JOIN_REND]

      37 -- RELAY_COMMAND_RENDEZVOUS2

            Sent from rendezvous point to client;
            reports join of host's circuit to
            client's circuit. Discussed in [JOIN_REND]

      38 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRO_ESTABLISHED

            Sent from introduction point to hidden service host;
            reports status of attempt to establish introduction
            point. Discussed in [INTRO_ESTABLISHED]

      39 -- RELAY_COMMAND_RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED

            Sent from rendezvous point to client; acknowledges
            receipt of ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS cell. Discussed in
            [EST_REND_POINT]

      40 -- RELAY_COMMAND_INTRODUCE_ACK

            Sent from introduction point to client; acknowledges
            receipt of INTRODUCE1 cell and reports success/failure.
            Discussed in [INTRO_ACK]

1. Protocol overview

   In this section, we outline the hidden service protocol. This section
   omits some details in the name of simplicity; those are given more
   fully below, when we specify the protocol in more detail.

1.1. View from 10,000 feet

   A hidden service host prepares to offer a hidden service by choosing
   several Tor nodes to serve as its introduction points. It builds
   circuits to those nodes, and tells them to forward introduction
   requests to it using those circuits.

   Once introduction points have been picked, the host builds a set of
   documents called "hidden service descriptors" (or just "descriptors"
   for short) and uploads them to a set of HSDir nodes. These documents
   list the hidden service's current introduction points and describe
   how to make contact with the hidden service.

   When a client wants to connect to a hidden service, it first chooses
   a Tor node at random to be its "rendezvous point" and builds a
   circuit to that rendezvous point. If the client does not have an
   up-to-date descriptor for the service, it contacts an appropriate
   HSDir and requests such a descriptor.

   The client then builds an anonymous circuit to one of the hidden
   service's introduction points listed in its descriptor, and gives the
   introduction point an introduction request to pass to the hidden
   service. This introduction request includes the target rendezvous
   point and the first part of a cryptographic handshake.

   Upon receiving the introduction request, the hidden service host
   makes an anonymous circuit to the rendezvous point and completes the
   cryptographic handshake. The rendezvous point connects the two
   circuits, and the cryptographic handshake gives the two parties a
   shared key and proves to the client that it is indeed talking to the
   hidden service.

   Once the two circuits are joined, the client can send Tor RELAY cells
   to the server. RELAY_BEGIN cells open streams to an external process
   or processes configured by the server; RELAY_DATA cells are used to
   communicate data on those streams, and so forth.

1.2. In more detail: naming hidden services [NAMING]

   A hidden service's name is its long term master identity key.  This
   is encoded as a hostname by encoding the entire key in Base 32, and
   adding the string ".onion" at the end.

   (This is a change from older versions of the hidden service protocol,
   where we used an 80-bit truncated SHA1 hash of a 1024 bit RSA key.)

   The names in this format are distinct from earlier names because of
   their length. An older name might look like:

        unlikelynamefora.onion
        yyhws9optuwiwsns.onion

   And a new name following this specification might look like:

        a1uik0w1gmfq3i5ievxdm9ceu27e88g6o7pe0rffdw9jmntwkdsd.onion

   Note that since master keys are 32 bytes long, and 52 bytes of base
   32 encoding can hold 260 bits of information, we have four unused
   bits in each of these names.

   [TODO: Alternatively, we could require that the first bit of the
   master key always be zero, and use a 51-byte encoding. Or we could
   require that the first two bits be zero, and use a 51-byte encoding
   and reserve the first bit. Or we could require that the first nine
   bits, or ten bits be zero, etc.]

1.3. In more detail: Access control [IMD:AC]

   Access control for a hidden service is imposed at multiple points
   through the process above.

   In order to download a descriptor, clients must know which blinded
   signing key was used to sign it. (See the next section for more info
   on key blinding.)  This blinded signing key is derived from the
   service's public key and, optionally, an additional secret that is
   not part of the hidden service's onion address. The public key and
   this secret together constitute the service's "credential".

   When the secret is in use, the hidden service gains protections
   equivalent to the "stealth mode" in previous designs.

   To learn the introduction points, the clients must decrypt the body
   of the hidden service descriptor. The encryption key for these is
   derived from the service's credential.

   In order to make the introduction point send a rendezvous request to the
   service, the client needs to use the per-introduction-point authentication
   key found in the hidden service descriptor.

   The final level of access control happens at the server itself, which
   may decide to respond or not respond to the client's request
   depending on the contents of the request. The protocol is extensible
   at this point: at a minimum, the server requires that the client
   demonstrate knowledge of the contents of the encrypted portion of the
   hidden service descriptor. The service may additionally require a
   user- or group-specific access token before it responds to requests.

1.4. In more detail: Distributing hidden service descriptors. [IMD:DIST]

   Periodically, hidden service descriptors become stored at different
   locations to prevent a single directory or small set of directories
   from becoming a good DoS target for removing a hidden service.

   For each period, the Tor directory authorities agree upon a
   collaboratively generated random value. (See section 2.3 for a
   description of how to incorporate this value into the voting
   practice; generating the value is described in other proposals,
   including [SHAREDRANDOM-REFS].) That value, combined with hidden service
   directories' public identity keys, determines each HSDir's position
   in the hash ring for descriptors made in that period.

   Each hidden service's descriptors are placed into the ring in
   positions based on the key that was used to sign them. Note that
   hidden service descriptors are not signed with the services' public
   keys directly. Instead, we use a key-blinding system [KEYBLIND] to
   create a new key-of-the-day for each hidden service. Any client that
   knows the hidden service's credential can derive these blinded
   signing keys for a given period. It should be impossible to derive
   the blinded signing key lacking that credential.

   The body of each descriptor is also encrypted with a key derived from
   the credential.

   To avoid a "thundering herd" problem where every service generates
   and uploads a new descriptor at the start of each period, each
   descriptor comes online at a time during the period that depends on
   its blinded signing key. The keys for the last period remain valid
   until the new keys come online.

1.5. In more detail: Scaling to multiple hosts

   This design is compatible with our current approaches for scaling hidden
   services. Specifically, hidden service operators can use onionbalance to
   achieve high availability between multiple nodes on the HSDir
   layer. Furthermore, operators can use proposal 255 to load balance their
   hidden services on the introduction layer. See [SCALING-REFS] for further
   discussions on this topic and alternative designs.

1.6. In more detail: Backward compatibility with older hidden service
      protocols

   This design is incompatible with the clients, server, and hsdir node
   protocols from older versions of the hidden service protocol as
   described in rend-spec.txt. On the other hand, it is designed to
   enable the use of older Tor nodes as rendezvous points and
   introduction points.

1.7. In more detail: Keeping crypto keys offline

   In this design, a hidden service's secret identity key may be
   stored offline.  It's used only to generate blinded signing keys,
   which are used to sign descriptor signing keys.

   In order to operate a hidden service, the operator can generate in
   advance a number of blinded signing keys and descriptor signing
   keys (and their credentials; see [DESC-OUTER] and [ENCRYPTED-DATA]
   below), and their corresponding descriptor encryption keys, and
   export those to the hidden service hosts.

   As a result, in the scenario where the Hidden Service gets
   compromised, the adversary can only impersonate it for a limited
   period of time (depending on how many signing keys were generated
   in advance).

   It's important to not send the private part of the blinded signing
   key to the Hidden Service since an attacker can derive from it the
   secret master identity key. The secret blinded signing key should
   only be used to create credentials for the descriptor signing keys.

1.8. In more detail: Encryption Keys And Replay Resistance

   To avoid replays of an introduction request by an introduction point,
   a hidden service host must never accept the same request
   twice. Earlier versions of the hidden service design used an
   authenticated timestamp here, but including a view of the current
   time can create a problematic fingerprint. (See proposal 222 for more
   discussion.)

1.9. In more detail: A menagerie of keys

   [In the text below, an "encryption keypair" is roughly "a keypair you
   can do Diffie-Hellman with" and a "signing keypair" is roughly "a
   keypair you can do ECDSA with."]

   Public/private keypairs defined in this document:

      Master (hidden service) identity key -- A master signing keypair
        used as the identity for a hidden service.  This key is long
        term and not used on its own to sign anything; it is only used
        to generate blinded signing keys as described in [KEYBLIND]
        and [SUBCRED]. The public key is encoded in the ".onion"
        address according to [NAMING].

      Blinded signing key -- A keypair derived from the identity key,
        used to sign descriptor signing keys. It changes periodically for
        each service. Clients who know a 'credential' consisting of the
        service's public identity key and an optional secret can derive
        the public blinded identity key for a service.  This key is used
        as an index in the DHT-like structure of the directory system
        (see [SUBCRED]).

      Descriptor signing key -- A key used to sign hidden service
        descriptors.  This is signed by blinded signing keys. Unlike
        blinded signing keys and master identity keys, the secret part
        of this key must be stored online by hidden service hosts. The
        public part of this key is included in the unencrypted section
        of HS descriptors (see [DESC-OUTER]).

      Introduction point authentication key -- A short-term signing
        keypair used to identify a hidden service to a given
        introduction point. A fresh keypair is made for each
        introduction point; these are used to sign the request that a
        hidden service host makes when establishing an introduction
        point, so that clients who know the public component of this key
        can get their introduction requests sent to the right
        service. No keypair is ever used with more than one introduction
        point. (previously called a "service key" in rend-spec.txt)

      Introduction point encryption key -- A short-term encryption
        keypair used when establishing connections via an introduction
        point. Plays a role analogous to Tor nodes' onion keys. A fresh
        keypair is made for each introduction point.

   Symmetric keys defined in this document:

      Descriptor encryption keys -- A symmetric encryption key used to
        encrypt the body of hidden service descriptors. Derived from the
        current period and the hidden service credential.

   Public/private keypairs defined elsewhere:

      Onion key -- Short-term encryption keypair

      (Node) identity key

   Symmetric key-like things defined elsewhere:

      KH from circuit handshake -- An unpredictable value derived as
      part of the Tor circuit extension handshake, used to tie a request
      to a particular circuit.


2. Generating and publishing hidden service descriptors [HSDIR]

   Hidden service descriptors follow the same metaformat as other Tor
   directory objects. They are published anonymously to Tor servers with
   the HSDir3 flag.

   (Authorities should assign this flag as they currently assign the
   HSDir flag, except that they should restrict it to Tor versions
   implementing the HSDir parts of this specification.)

2.1. Deriving blinded keys and subcredentials [SUBCRED]

   In each time period (see [TIME-PERIOD] for a definition of time
   periods), a hidden service host uses a different blinded private key
   to sign its directory information, and clients use a different
   blinded public key as the index for fetching that information.

   For a candidate for a key derivation method, see Appendix [KEYBLIND].

   Additionally, clients and hosts derive a subcredential for each
   period. Knowledge of the subcredential is needed to decrypt hidden
   service descriptors for each period and to authenticate with the
   hidden service host in the introduction process. Unlike the
   credential, it changes each period. Knowing the subcredential, even
   in combination with the blinded private key, does not enable the
   hidden service host to derive the main credential--therefore, it is
   safe to put the subcredential on the hidden service host while
   leaving the hidden service's private key offline.

   The subcredential for a period is derived as:

       subcredential = H("subcredential" | credential | blinded-public-key).

   In the above formula, credential corresponds to:

       credential = H(public-identity-key | authorization-key)

   where public-identity-key is the public identity master key of the hidden
   service, and authorization-key is an optional secret used for client
   authorization. If no client authorization is specified, authorization-key is
   left blank.

2.2. Locating, uploading, and downloading hidden service descriptors
       [HASHRING]

   To avoid attacks where a hidden service's descriptor is easily
   targeted for censorship, we store them at different directories over
   time, and use shared random values to prevent those directories from
   being predictable far in advance.

   Which Tor servers hosts a hidden service depends on:

         * the current time period,
         * the daily subcredential,
         * the hidden service directories' public keys,
         * a shared random value that changes in each time period,
         * a set of network-wide networkstatus consensus parameters.
           (Consensus parameters are integer values voted on by authorities
           and published in the consensus documents, described in
           dir-spec.txt, section 3.3.)

   Below we explain in more detail.

2.2.1. Dividing time into periods [TIME-PERIODS]

   To prevent a single set of hidden service directory from becoming a
   target by adversaries looking to permanently censor a hidden service,
   hidden service descriptors are uploaded to different locations that
   change over time.

   The length of a "time period" is controlled by the consensus
   parameter 'hsdir-interval', and is a number of minutes between 30 and
   14400 (10 days). The default time period length is 1440 (one day).

   Time periods start at the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970), and are computed by
   taking the number of minutes since the epoch and dividing by the time
   period. However, we want our time periods to start at 12:00UTC every day, so
   we subtract a "rotation time offset" of 12*60 minutes from the number of
   minutes since the epoch, before dividing by the time period (effectively
   making "our" epoch start at Jan 1, 1970 12:00UTC).

   Example: If the current time is 2016-04-13 11:15:01 UTC, making the seconds
   since the epoch 1460546101, and the number of minutes since the epoch
   24342435.  We then subtract the "rotation time offset" of 12*60 minutes from
   the minutes since the epoch, to get 24341715. If the current time period
   length is 1440 minutes, by doing the division we see that we are currently
   in time period number 16903.

   Specifically, time period #16903 began 16903*1440*60 + (12*60*60) seconds
   after the epoch at 2016-04-12 12:00 UTC, and ended at (16904+1)*1500*60 +
   (12*60*60) seconds after the epoch at 2016-04-13 12:00 UTC.

2.2.2. When to publish a hidden service descriptor [WHEN-HSDESC]

   Hidden services periodically publish their descriptor to the responsible HSDirs.
   The set of responsible HSDirs is determined as specified in [WHERE-HSDESC].

   Specifically, everytime a hidden service publishes its descriptor, it also
   sets up a timer for a random time between 60 minutes and 120 minutes in the
   future. When the timer triggers, the hidden service needs to publish its
   descriptor again to the responsible HSDirs for that time period.
   [TODO: Control republish period using a consensus parameter?]

2.2.2.1. Overlapping descriptors

   Hidden services need to upload their descriptors to the HSDirs _before_ the
   beginning of each time period, so that they are readily available for
   clients to fetch them. However, if every hidden service were to upload a new
   descriptor at exactly the start of each time period, directories would get
   overwhelmed by every host uploading at the same time.

   To avoid this thundering herd problem, hidden services upload descriptors
   for the upcoming time period at a random time _before_ the time period starts.

   For the above "descriptor overlap" system to work, fresh shared random
   values must be available multiple hours *before* the time period changes, so
   that hidden services have enough time to publish their overlap descriptors
   to the future set of responsible HSDirs. In the current system, fresh shared
   random values get published at 00:00UTC every day, whereas the time period
   changes at 12:00UTC, giving 12 hours for hidden services to fetch new
   consensuses and upload overlap descriptors.

   Specifically, when a hidden service fetches a consensus with "valid-after"
   between 00:00UTC and 12:00UTC, it goes into "descriptor overlap"
   mode. During "descriptor overlap" mode, the hidden service uploads its
   descriptor to the HSDirs of the current time period (using the previous SRV
   from the consensus) _and_ it also uploads its descriptors for the upcoming
   time period (using the current SRV from the consensus).

   The above mechanism ensures that when the time period starts at 12:00UTC,
   the hidden service will already have uploaded its descriptors to the
   responsible HSDirs for that time period.

   [TODO: What to do when we run multiple hidden services in a single host?]

2.2.3. Where to publish a hidden service descriptor [WHERE-HSDESC]

   The following consensus parameters control where a hidden service
   descriptor is stored;

        hsdir_n_replicas = an integer in range [1,16] with default value 2.
        hsdir_spread_fetch = an integer in range [1,128] with default value 3.
        hsdir_spread_store = an integer in range [1,128] with default value 3.

   To determine where a given hidden service descriptor will be stored
   in a given period, after the blinded public key for that period is
   derived, the uploading or downloading party calculates:

        for replicanum in 1...hsdir_n_replicas:
            hs_index(replicanum) = H("store-at-idx" |
                                 blinded_public_key |
                                 INT_8(replicanum) |
                                 INT_8(period_num) )

   where blinded_public_key is specified in section [KEYBLIND], and period_num
   is calculated using the current consensus "valid-after" as specified in
   section [TIME-PERIODS].

   Then, for each node listed in the current consensus with the HSDirV3 flag,
   we compute a directory index for that node as:

           hsdir_index(node) = H("node-idx" | node_identity |
                                 shared_random_value |
                                 INT_8(period_num) )

   where shared_random_value is the shared value generated by the authorities
   in section [PUB-SHAREDRANDOM], and node_identity is the ed25519 identity key
   of the node.

   Finally, for replicanum in 1...hsdir_n_replicas, the hidden service
   host uploads descriptors to the first hsdir_spread_store nodes whose
   indices immediately follow hs_index(replicanum). If any of those
   nodes have already been selected for a lower-numbered replica of the
   service, any nodes already chosen are disregarded (i.e. skipped over)
   when choosing a replica's hsdir_spread_store nodes.

   When choosing an HSDir to download from, clients choose randomly from
   among the first hsdir_spread_fetch nodes after the indices.  (Note
   that, in order to make the system better tolerate disappearing
   HSDirs, hsdir_spread_fetch may be less than hsdir_spread_store.)
   Again, nodes from lower-numbered replicas are disregarded when
   choosing the spread for a replica.

2.2.4. Using time periods and SRVs to fetch/upload HS descriptors

   Hidden services and clients need to make correct use of time periods and
   shared random values (SRVs) to successfuly fetch and upload descriptors.

   As [PUB-SHAREDRANDOM] specifies, consensuses contain two shared random
   values (the current one and the previous one). Hidden services and clients
   are asked to match these shared random values with descriptor time periods
   and use the right SRV when fetching/uploading descriptors. This section
   attempts to precisely specify how this works.

   Let's start with an illustration of the system:

      +------------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                                                                  |
      | 00:00      12:00       00:00       12:00       00:00       12:00 |
      | SRV#1      TP#1        SRV#2       TP#2        SRV#3       TP#3  |
      |                                                                  |
      |  $==========|-----------$===========|-----------$===========|    |
      |                                                                  |
      |                                                                  |
      +------------------------------------------------------------------+

                                      Legend: [TP#1 = Time Period #1]
                                              [SRV#1 = Shared Random Value #1]
                                              ["=" denotes descriptor overlap period]

   Looking at the diagram above, SRV#1 gets published 12 hours before TP#1
   starts and TP#1 lasts 24 hours. By defining the lifetime of SRV#1 to be 36
   hours, we can pair SRV#1 with TP#1.

   Hence, when clients and hidden services see an SRV for the first time, they
   calculate its expiry date (using a 36 hour lifetime) and use that SRV for
   uploading/fetching descriptors until it expires. When that SRV expires, they
   switch to the next SRV in the consensus.

   Hidden services in "descriptor overlap" mode _always_ use the current SRV
   for publishing overlap descriptors. Clients on the other hand ignore the
   overlap period and always fetch the descriptor of the current time period.

   For examples and discussion on this technique, please see [SRV-TP-REFS].

2.2.5. Expiring hidden service descriptors [EXPIRE-DESC]

   Hidden services set their descriptor's "descriptor-lifetime" field to 180
   minutes (3 hours). Hidden services ensure that their descriptor will remain
   valid in the HSDir caches, by republishing their descriptors periodically as
   specified in [WHEN-HSDESC].

   Hidden services MUST also keep their introduction circuits alive for as long
   as descriptors including those intro points are valid (even if that's after
   the time period has changed).

2.2.6. URLs for anonymous uploading and downloading

   Hidden service descriptors conforming to this specification are
   uploaded with an HTTP POST request to the URL
   /tor/rendezvous3/publish relative to the hidden service directory's
   root, and downloaded with an HTTP GET request for the URL
   /tor/rendezvous3/<z> where z is a base-64 encoding of the hidden
   service's blinded public key.

   These requests must be made anonymously, on circuits not used for
   anything else.

2.3. Publishing shared random values [PUB-SHAREDRANDOM]

   Our design for limiting the predictability of HSDir upload locations
   relies on a shared random value (SRV) that isn't predictable in advance or
   too influenceable by an attacker. The authorities must run a protocol
   to generate such a value at least once per hsdir period. Here we
   describe how they publish these values; the procedure they use to
   generate them can change independently of the rest of this
   specification. For more information see [SHAREDRANDOM-REFS].

   According to proposal 250, we add two new lines in consensuses:

     "shared-rand-previous-value" SP NUM_REVEALS SP VALUE NL
     "shared-rand-current-value" SP NUM_REVEALS SP VALUE NL

2.3.1. Client behavior in the absense of shared random values

   If the previous or current shared random value cannot be found in a
   consensus, then Tor clients and services need to generate their own random
   value for use when choosing HSDirs.

   To do so, Tor clients and services use:

     SRV = HMAC("shared-random-disaster", TIME_PERIOD_NUM)

   as the SRV for time period TIME_PERIOD_NUM.

2.3.2. Hidden services and changing shared random values

   It's theoretically possible that the consensus shared random values will
   change or disappear in the middle of a time period because of directory
   authorities dropping offline or misbehaving.

   To avoid client reachability issues in this rare event, hidden services
   should use the new shared random values to find the new responsible HSDirs
   and upload their descriptors there.

   XXX How long should they upload descriptors there for?

2.4. Hidden service descriptors: outer wrapper [DESC-OUTER]

   The format for a hidden service descriptor is as follows, using the
   meta-format from dir-spec.txt.

     "hs-descriptor" SP version-number NL

       [At start, exactly once.]

       The version-number contains a positive integer indicating the version
       of the descriptor. Current version is "3".

     "descriptor-lifetime" SP LifetimeMinutes NL

       [Exactly once]

       The lifetime of a descriptor in minutes. An HSDir SHOULD expire the
       hidden service descriptor at least LifetimeMinutes after it was uploaded.

       The LifetimeMinutes field can take values between 30 and 3000 (50 hours).

    "descriptor-signing-key-cert" NL certificate NL

       [Exactly once.]

       The 'certificate' field contains a certificate in the format from
       proposal 220, wrapped with "-----BEGIN ED25519 CERT-----".  The
       certificate cross-certifies the short-term descriptor signing key with
       the blinded public key.  The certificate type must be [08], and the
       blinded public key must be present as the signing-key extension.

     "revision-counter" SP Integer NL

       [Exactly once.]

       The revision number of the descriptor. If an HSDir receives a
       second descriptor for a key that it already has a descriptor for,
       it should retain and serve the descriptor with the higher
       revision-counter.

       (Checking for monotonically increasing revision-counter values
       prevents an attacker from replacing a newer descriptor signed by
       a given key with a copy of an older version.)

     "encrypted" NL encrypted-string

       [Exactly once.]

       An encrypted blob, whose format is discussed in [ENCRYPTED-DATA]
       below. The blob is base-64 encoded and enclosed in -----BEGIN
       MESSAGE---- and ----END MESSAGE---- wrappers.

     "signature" SP signature NL

       [exactly once, at end.]

       A signature of all previous fields, using the signing key in the
       descriptor-signing-key-cert line. We use a separate key for signing, so that
       the hidden service host does not need to have its private blinded
       key online.

2.5. Hidden service descriptors: encryption format [ENCRYPTED-DATA]

   The encrypted part of the hidden service descriptor is encrypted and
   authenticated with symmetric keys generated as follows:

       SALT = 16 bytes from H(random), changes each time we rebuld the
              descriptor even if the content of the descriptor hasn't changed.
              (So that we don't leak whether the intro point list etc. changed)

       secret_input = blinded_public_key | subcredential | INT_8(revision_counter)
       keys = KDF(secret_input, salt, "hsdir-encrypted-data",
                  S_KEY_LEN + S_IV_LEN + MAC_KEY_LEN)

       SECRET_KEY = first S_KEY_LEN bytes of keys
       SECRET_IV  = next S_IV_LEN bytes of keys
       MAC_KEY    = last MAC_KEY_LEN bytes of keys

   The encrypted data has the format:

       SALT       hashed random bytes from above  [16 bytes]
       ENCRYPTED  The plaintext encrypted with S  [variable]
       MAC        MAC of both above fields        [32 bytes]

   The encryption format is ENCRYPTED =
               STREAM(SECRET_IV,SECRET_KEY) XOR Plaintext

   Before encryption, the plaintext must be padded to a multiple of 4096 bytes
   with NUL bytes.

   The plaintext format is:

     "create2-formats" SP formats NL

      [Exactly once]

      A space-separated list of integers denoting CREATE2 cell format numbers
      that the server recognizes. Must include at least ntor as described in
      tor-spec.txt. See tor-spec section 5.1 for a list of recognized
      handshake types.

     "authentication-required" SP types NL

      [At most once]

      A space-separated list of authentication types. A client that does
      not support at least one of these authentication types will not be
      able to contact the host. Recognized types are: 'password' and
      'ed25519'. See [INTRO-AUTH] below.

     Followed by zero or more introduction points as follows:

        "introduction-point" SP link-specifiers NL

          [Exactly once per introduction point at start of introduction
            point section]

          The link-specifiers is a base64 encoding of a link specifier
          block in the format described in BUILDING-BLOCKS.

        "auth-key" NL certificate NL

          [Exactly once per introduction point]

          The certificate is a proposal 220 certificate wrapped in
          "-----BEGIN ED25519 CERT-----", cross-certifying the descriptor
          signing key with the introduction point authentication key, which
          is included in the mandatory signing-key extension.  The certificate
          type must be [09].

        Encryption key is specified as follow:

        [Exactly once enc-key per introduction point]

           "enc-key" SP "ntor" SP key NL

             The key is a base64 encoded curve25519 public key used to encrypt
             the introduction request to service.

           "enc-key" SP "legacy" NL key NL

             Base64 encoded RSA key, wrapped in "----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC
             KEY-----" armor, for use with a legacy introduction point as
             described in [LEGACY_EST_INTRO] and [LEGACY-INTRODUCE1] below.

        "enc-key-certification" NL certificate NL

          [Exactly once per introduction point]

          Cross-certification of the descriptor signing key by the enc-key.
          The format of this certificate depends on the type of enc-key.

          For "ntor" keys, certificate is a proposal 220 certificate in
          "-----BEGIN ED25519 CERT-----" armor, cross-certifying the
          descriptor signing key with the ed25519 equivalent of the curve25519
          public key from "enc-key" derived using the process in proposal 228
          appendix A. The certificate type must be [10], and the signing-key
          extension is mandatory.

          For "legacy" keys, certificate is an RSA signature wrapped in
          "-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----" of the digest:
              H("legacy introduction point encryption key" | ED25519_KEY)
          ED25519_KEY is the 32 byte descriptor signing public key.

   To remain compatible with future revisions to the descriptor format,
   clients should ignore unrecognized lines in the descriptor.
   Other encryption and authentication key formats are allowed; clients
   should ignore ones they do not recognize.


3. The introduction protocol

   The introduction protocol proceeds in three steps.

   First, a hidden service host builds an anonymous circuit to a Tor
   node and registers that circuit as an introduction point.

        [After 'First' and before 'Second', the hidden service publishes its
        introduction points and associated keys, and the client fetches
        them as described in section [HSDIR] above.]

   Second, a client builds an anonymous circuit to the introduction
   point, and sends an introduction request.

   Third, the introduction point relays the introduction request along
   the introduction circuit to the hidden service host, and acknowledges
   the introduction request to the client.

3.1. Registering an introduction point [REG_INTRO_POINT]

3.1.1. Extensible ESTABLISH_INTRO protocol. [EST_INTRO]

   When a hidden service is establishing a new introduction point, it
   sends an ESTABLISH_INTRO cell with the following contents:

     AUTH_KEY_TYPE    [1 byte]
     AUTH_KEY_LEN     [2 bytes]
     AUTH_KEY         [AUTH_KEY_LEN bytes]
     N_EXTENSIONS     [1 byte]
     N_EXTENSIONS times:
        EXT_FIELD_TYPE [1 byte]
        EXT_FIELD_LEN  [1 byte]
        EXT_FIELD      [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]
     HANDSHAKE_AUTH   [MAC_LEN bytes]
     SIG_LEN          [2 bytes]
     SIG              [SIG_LEN bytes]

   The AUTH_KEY_TYPE field indicates the type of the introduction point
   authentication key and the type of the MAC to use in
   HANDSHAKE_AUTH. Recognized types are:

       [00, 01] -- Reserved for legacy introduction cells; see
                   [LEGACY_EST_INTRO below]
       [02] -- Ed25519; SHA3-256.

   The AUTH_KEY_LEN field determines the length of the AUTH_KEY
   field. The AUTH_KEY field contains the public introduction point
   authentication key.

   The EXT_FIELD_TYPE, EXT_FIELD_LEN, EXT_FIELD entries are reserved for
   future extensions to the introduction protocol. Extensions with
   unrecognized EXT_FIELD_TYPE values must be ignored.

   The HANDSHAKE_AUTH field contains the MAC of all earlier fields in
   the cell using as its key the shared per-circuit material ("KH")
   generated during the circuit extension protocol; see tor-spec.txt
   section 5.2, "Setting circuit keys". It prevents replays of
   ESTABLISH_INTRO cells.

   SIG_LEN is the length of the signature.

   SIG is a signature, using AUTH_KEY, of all contents of the cell, up
   to but not including SIG. These contents are prefixed with the string
   "Tor establish-intro cell v1".

   Upon receiving an ESTABLISH_INTRO cell, a Tor node first decodes the
   key and the signature, and checks the signature. The node must reject
   the ESTABLISH_INTRO cell and destroy the circuit in these cases:

        * If the key type is unrecognized
        * If the key is ill-formatted
        * If the signature is incorrect
        * If the HANDSHAKE_AUTH value is incorrect

        * If the circuit is already a rendezvous circuit.
        * If the circuit is already an introduction circuit.
          [TODO: some scalability designs fail there.]
        * If the key is already in use by another circuit.

   Otherwise, the node must associate the key with the circuit, for use
   later in INTRODUCE1 cells.

3.1.2. Registering an introduction point on a legacy Tor node [LEGACY_EST_INTRO]

   Tor nodes should also support an older version of the ESTABLISH_INTRO
   cell, first documented in rend-spec.txt. New hidden service hosts
   must use this format when establishing introduction points at older
   Tor nodes that do not support the format above in [EST_INTRO].

   In this older protocol, an ESTABLISH_INTRO cell contains:

        KEY_LEN        [2 bytes]
        KEY            [KEY_LEN bytes]
        HANDSHAKE_AUTH [20 bytes]
        SIG            [variable, up to end of relay payload]

   The KEY_LEN variable determines the length of the KEY field.

   The KEY field is the ASN1-encoded legacy RSA public key that was also
   included in the hidden service descriptor.

   The HANDSHAKE_AUTH field contains the SHA1 digest of (KH | "INTRODUCE").

   The SIG field contains an RSA signature, using PKCS1 padding, of all
   earlier fields.

   Older versions of Tor always use a 1024-bit RSA key for these introduction
   authentication keys.

3.1.3. Acknowledging establishment of introduction point [INTRO_ESTABLISHED]

   After setting up an introduction circuit, the introduction point reports its
   status back to the hidden service host with an INTRO_ESTABLISHED cell.

   The INTRO_ESTABLISHED cell has the following contents:

     N_EXTENSIONS [1 byte]
     N_EXTENSIONS times:
       EXT_FIELD_TYPE [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD_LEN  [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD      [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]

   Older versions of Tor send back an empty INTRO_ESTABLISHED cell instead.
   Services must accept an empty INTRO_ESTABLISHED cell from a legacy relay.

3.2. Sending an INTRODUCE1 cell to the introduction point. [SEND_INTRO1]

   In order to participate in the introduction protocol, a client must
   know the following:

     * An introduction point for a service.
     * The introduction authentication key for that introduction point.
     * The introduction encryption key for that introduction point.

   The client sends an INTRODUCE1 cell to the introduction point,
   containing an identifier for the service, an identifier for the
   encryption key that the client intends to use, and an opaque blob to
   be relayed to the hidden service host.

   In reply, the introduction point sends an INTRODUCE_ACK cell back to
   the client, either informing it that its request has been delivered,
   or that its request will not succeed.

   [TODO: specify what tor should do when receiving a malformed cell. Drop it?
          Kill circuit? This goes for all possible cells.]

3.2.1. INTRODUCE1 cell format [FMT_INTRO1]

   When a client is connecting to an introduction point, INTRODUCE1 cells
   should be of the form:

     LEGACY_KEY_ID   [20 bytes]
     AUTH_KEY_TYPE   [1 byte]
     AUTH_KEY_LEN    [2 bytes]
     AUTH_KEY        [AUTH_KEY_LEN bytes]
     N_EXTENSIONS    [1 byte]
     N_EXTENSIONS times:
       EXT_FIELD_TYPE [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD_LEN  [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD      [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]
     ENCRYPTED        [Up to end of relay payload]

   The LEGACY_KEY_ID field is used to distinguish between legacy and new style
   INTRODUCE1 cells. In new style INTRODUCE1 cells, LEGACY_KEY_ID is 20 zero
   bytes. Upon receiving an INTRODUCE1 cell, the introduction point checks the
   LEGACY_KEY_ID field. If LEGACY_KEY_ID is non-zero, the INTRODUCE1 cell
   should be handled as specified in [LEGACY-INTRODUCE1].

   AUTH_KEY_TYPE is defined as in [EST_INTRO]. Currently, the only value of
   AUTH_KEY_TYPE for this cell is an Ed25519 public key [02].

   Upon receiving a INTRODUCE1 cell, the introduction point checks
   whether AUTH_KEY matches the introduction point authentication key for an
   active introduction circuit.  If so, the introduction point sends an
   INTRODUCE2 cell with exactly the same contents to the service, and sends an
   INTRODUCE_ACK response to the client.

3.2.2. Legacy formats [LEGACY-INTRODUCE1]

   For legacy introduction points, INTRODUCE1 cells should be of the form:

     LEGACY_KEY_ID        [20 bytes]
     N_EXTENSIONS         [1 byte]
     N_EXTENSIONS times:
       EXT_FIELD_TYPE     [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD_LEN      [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD          [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]
     ENCRYPTED            [Up to end of relay payload]

   Here, LEGACY_KEY_ID is the hash of the introduction point legacy
   encryption key that was included in the hidden service descriptor.

   Because of limitations in older versions of Tor, the relay payload size for
   these INTRODUCE1 cells must always be at least 246 bytes, or they will be
   rejected as invalid. The ENCRYPTED field may contain padding to reach this
   length.

3.2.3. INTRODUCE_ACK cell format. [INTRO_ACK]

   An INTRODUCE_ACK cell has the following fields:

     STATUS       [2 bytes]
     N_EXTENSIONS [1 bytes]
     N_EXTENSIONS times:
       EXT_FIELD_TYPE [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD_LEN  [1 byte]
       EXT_FIELD      [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]

   Recognized status values are:
     [00 00] -- Success: cell relayed to hidden service host.
     [00 01] -- Failure: service ID not recognized
     [00 02] -- Bad message format

3.3. Processing an INTRODUCE2 cell at the hidden service. [PROCESS_INTRO2]

   Upon receiving an INTRODUCE2 cell, the hidden service host checks whether
   the AUTH_KEY or LEGACY_KEY_ID field matches the keys for this
   introduction circuit.

   The service host then checks whether it has received a cell with
   these contents before. If it has, it silently drops it as a
   replay. (It must maintain a replay cache for as long as it accepts
   cells with the same encryption key. Note that the encryption format below
   should be non-malleable.)

   If the cell is not a replay, it decrypts the ENCRYPTED field,
   establishes a shared key with the client, and authenticates the whole
   contents of the cell as having been unmodified since they left the
   client. There may be multiple ways of decrypting the ENCRYTPED field,
   depending on the chosen type of the encryption key. Requirements for
   an introduction handshake protocol are described in
   [INTRO-HANDSHAKE-REQS]. We specify one below in section
   [NTOR-WITH-EXTRA-DATA].

   The decrypted plaintext must have the form:

      RENDEZVOUS_COOKIE                          [20 bytes]
      N_EXTENSIONS                               [1 byte]
      N_EXTENSIONS times:
          EXT_FIELD_TYPE                         [1 byte]
          EXT_FIELD_LEN                          [1 byte]
          EXT_FIELD                              [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]
      ONION_KEY_TYPE                             [1 bytes]
      ONION_KEY_LEN                              [2 bytes]
      ONION_KEY                                  [ONION_KEY_LEN bytes]
      NSPEC      (Number of link specifiers)     [1 byte]
      NSPEC times:
          LSTYPE (Link specifier type)           [1 byte]
          LSLEN  (Link specifier length)         [1 byte]
          LSPEC  (Link specifier)                [LSLEN bytes]
      PAD        (optional padding)              [up to end of plaintext]

   Upon processing this plaintext, the hidden service makes sure that
   any required authentication is present in the extension fields, and
   then extends a rendezvous circuit to the node described in the LSPEC
   fields, using the ONION_KEY to complete the extension. As mentioned
   in [BUILDING-BLOCKS], the "TLS-over-TCP, IPv4" and "Legacy node
   identity" specifiers must be present.

   The hidden service SHOULD NOT reject any LSTYPE fields which it
   doesn't recognize; instead, it should use them verbatim in its EXTEND
   request to the rendezvous point.

   The ONION_KEY_TYPE field is:

      [01] NTOR:          ONION_KEY is 32 bytes long.

   The ONION_KEY field describes the onion key that must be used when
   extending to the rendezvous point. It must be of a type listed as
   supported in the hidden service descriptor.

   When using a legacy introduction point, the INTRODUCE cells must be padded
   to a certain length using the PAD field in the encrypted portion.

   Upon receiving a well-formed INTRODUCE2 cell, the hidden service host
   will have:

     * The information needed to connect to the client's chosen
       rendezvous point.
     * The second half of a handshake to authenticate and establish a
       shared key with the hidden service client.
     * A set of shared keys to use for end-to-end encryption.

3.3.1. Introduction handshake encryption requirements [INTRO-HANDSHAKE-REQS]

   When decoding the encrypted information in an INTRODUCE2 cell, a
   hidden service host must be able to:

     * Decrypt additional information included in the INTRODUCE2 cell,
       to include the rendezvous token and the information needed to
       extend to the rendezvous point.

     * Establish a set of shared keys for use with the client.

     * Authenticate that the cell has not been modified since the client
       generated it.

   Note that the old TAP-derived protocol of the previous hidden service
   design achieved the first two requirements, but not the third.

3.3.2. Example encryption handshake: ntor with extra data [NTOR-WITH-EXTRA-DATA]

   [TODO: relocate this]

   This is a variant of the ntor handshake (see tor-spec.txt, section
   5.1.4; see proposal 216; and see "Anonymity and one-way
   authentication in key-exchange protocols" by Goldberg, Stebila, and
   Ustaoglu).

   It behaves the same as the ntor handshake, except that, in addition
   to negotiating forward secure keys, it also provides a means for
   encrypting non-forward-secure data to the server (in this case, to
   the hidden service host) as part of the handshake.

   Notation here is as in section 5.1.4 of tor-spec.txt, which defines
   the ntor handshake.

   The PROTOID for this variant is "tor-hs-ntor-curve25519-sha3-256-1".
   We also use the following tweak values:

      t_hsenc    = PROTOID | ":hs_key_extract"
      t_hsverify = PROTOID | ":hs_verify"
      t_hsmac    = PROTOID | ":hs_mac"
      m_hsexpand = PROTOID | ":hs_key_expand"

   To make an INTRODUCE1 cell, the client must know a public encryption
   key B for the hidden service on this introduction circuit. The client
   generates a single-use keypair:
             x,X = KEYGEN()
   and computes:
             secret_hs_input = EXP(B,x) | AUTH_KEYID | X | B | PROTOID
             info = m_hsexpand | subcredential
             hs_keys = KDF(secret_hs_input | t_hsenc | info, S_KEY_LEN+MAC_LEN)
             ENC_KEY = hs_keys[0:S_KEY_LEN]
             MAC_KEY = hs_keys[S_KEY_LEN:S_KEY_LEN+MAC_KEY_LEN]

   and sends, as the ENCRYPTED part of the INTRODUCE1 cell:

          CLIENT_PK                [G_LEN bytes]
          ENCRYPTED_DATA           [Padded to length of plaintext]
          MAC                      [MAC_LEN bytes]


   Substituting those fields into the INTRODUCE1 cell body format
   described in [FMT_INTRO1] above, we have

            AUTH_KEY_TYPE               [1 byte]
            AUTH_KEY_LEN                [2 bytes]
            AUTH_KEY                    [AUTH_KEY_LEN bytes]
            N_EXTENSIONS                [1 bytes]
            N_EXTENSIONS times:
               EXT_FIELD_TYPE           [1 byte]
               EXT_FIELD_LEN            [1 byte]
               EXT_FIELD                [EXT_FIELD_LEN bytes]
            ENCRYPTED:
               CLIENT_PK                [G_LEN bytes]
               ENCRYPTED_DATA           [Padded to length of plaintext]
               MAC                      [MAC_LEN bytes]


   (This format is as documented in [FMT_INTRO1] above, except that here
   we describe how to build the ENCRYPTED portion. If the introduction
   point is running an older Tor that does not support this protocol,
   the first field is replaced by a 20-byte AUTH_KEYID_HASH field as
   described in [LEGACY-INTRODUCE1].)

   Here, the encryption key plays the role of B in the regular ntor
   handshake, and the AUTH_KEY field plays the role of the node ID.
   The CLIENT_PK field is the public key X. The ENCRYPTED_DATA field is
   the message plaintext, encrypted with the symmetric key ENC_KEY. The
   MAC field is a MAC of all of the cell from the AUTH_KEY through the
   end of ENCRYPTED_DATA, using the MAC_KEY value as its key.

   To process this format, the hidden service checks PK_VALID(CLIENT_PK)
   as necessary, and then computes ENC_KEY and MAC_KEY as the client did
   above, except using EXP(CLIENT_PK,b) in the calculation of
   secret_hs_input. The service host then checks whether the MAC is
   correct. If it is invalid, it drops the cell. Otherwise, it computes
   the plaintext by decrypting ENCRYPTED_DATA.

   The hidden service host now completes the service side of the
   extended ntor handshake, as described in tor-spec.txt section 5.1.4,
   with the modified PROTOID as given above. To be explicit, the hidden
   service host generates a keypair of y,Y = KEYGEN(), and uses its
   introduction point encryption key 'b' to computes:

      secret_hs_input = EXP(X,b) | AUTH_KEYID | X | B | PROTOID
      info = m_hsexpand | subcredential
      hs_keys = KDF(secret_hs_input | t_hsenc | info, S_KEY_LEN+MAC_LEN)
      HS_DEC_KEY = hs_keys[0:S_KEY_LEN]
      HS_MAC_KEY = hs_keys[S_KEY_LEN:S_KEY_LEN+MAC_KEY_LEN]

      (The above are used to check the MAC and then decrypt the
      encrypted data.)

      ntor_secret_input = EXP(X,y) | EXP(X,b) | AUTH_KEYID | B | X | Y | PROTOID
      NTOR_KEY_SEED = MAC(ntor_secret_input, t_hsenc)
      verify = MAC(ntor_secret_input, t_hsverify)
      auth_input = verify | AUTH_KEYID | B | Y | X | PROTOID | "Server"

      (The above are used to finish the ntor handshake.)

   The server's handshake reply is:
       SERVER_PK   Y                         [G_LEN bytes]
       AUTH        MAC(auth_input, t_hsmac)  [H_LEN bytes]

   These fields will be sent to the client in a RENDEZVOUS1 cell using the
   HANDSHAKE_INFO element (see [JOIN_REND]).

   The hidden service host now also knows the keys generated by the
   handshake, which it will use to encrypt and authenticate data
   end-to-end between the client and the server. These keys are as
   computed in tor-spec.txt section 5.1.4.

3.4. Authentication during the introduction phase. [INTRO-AUTH]

   Hidden services may restrict access only to authorized users.  One
   mechanism to do so is the credential mechanism, where only users who
   know the credential for a hidden service may connect at all. For more
   fine-grained conntrol, a hidden service can be configured with
   password-based or public-key-based authentication.

3.4.1. Password-based authentication.

   To authenticate with a password, the user must include an extension
   field in the encrypted part of the INTRODUCE1 cell with an
   EXT_FIELD_TYPE type of [01] and the contents:

     Username [00] Password.

   The username may not include any [00] bytes. The password may.

   On the server side, the password MUST be stored hashed and salted,
   ideally with scrypt or something better.

3.4.2. Ed25519-based authentication.

   To authenticate with an Ed25519 private key, the user must include an
   extension field in the encrypted part of the INTRODUCE1 cell with an
   EXT_FIELD_TYPE type of [02] and the contents:

        Nonce     [16 bytes]
        Pubkey    [32 bytes]
        Signature [64 bytes]

   Nonce is a random value. Pubkey is the public key that will be used
   to authenticate. [TODO: should this be an identifier for the public
   key instead?]  Signature is the signature, using Ed25519, of:

        "hidserv-userauth-ed25519"
        Nonce       (same as above)
        Pubkey      (same as above)
        AUTH_KEY    (As in the INTRODUCE1 cell)

   The hidden service host checks this by seeing whether it recognizes
   and would accept a signature from the provided public key. If it
   would, then it checks whether the signature is correct. If it is,
   then the correct user has authenticated.

   Replay prevention on the whole cell is sufficient to prevent replays
   on the authentication.

   Users SHOULD NOT use the same public key with multiple hidden
   services.

4. The rendezvous protocol

   Before connecting to a hidden service, the client first builds a
   circuit to an arbitrarily chosen Tor node (known as the rendezvous
   point), and sends an ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS cell. The hidden service
   later connects to the same node and sends a RENDEZVOUS cell. Once
   this has occurred, the relay forwards the contents of the RENDEZVOUS
   cell to the client, and joins the two circuits together.

4.1. Establishing a rendezvous point [EST_REND_POINT]

   The client sends the rendezvous point a RELAY_COMMAND_ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS
   cell containing a 20-byte value.

            RENDEZVOUS_COOKIE         [20 bytes]

   Rendezvous points MUST ignore any extra bytes in an
   ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS cell. (Older versions of Tor did not.)

   The rendezvous cookie is an arbitrary 20-byte value, chosen randomly
   by the client. The client SHOULD choose a new rendezvous cookie for
   each new connection attempt. If the rendezvous cookie is already in
   use on an existing circuit, the rendezvous point should reject it and
   destroy the circuit.

   Upon receiving an ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS cell, the rendezvous point associates
   the cookie with the circuit on which it was sent. It replies to the client
   with an empty RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED cell to indicate success. Clients MUST
   ignore any extra bytes in a RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED cell.

   The client MUST NOT use the circuit which sent the cell for any
   purpose other than rendezvous with the given location-hidden service.

   The client should establish a rendezvous point BEFORE trying to
   connect to a hidden service.

4.2. Joining to a rendezvous point [JOIN_REND]

   To complete a rendezvous, the hidden service host builds a circuit to
   the rendezvous point and sends a RENDEZVOUS1 cell containing:

       RENDEZVOUS_COOKIE          [20 bytes]
       HANDSHAKE_INFO             [variable; depends on handshake type
                                   used.]

   where RENDEZVOUS_COOKIE is the cookie suggested by the client
   during the introduction (see [PROCESS_INTRO2]).

   If the cookie matches the rendezvous cookie set on any
   not-yet-connected circuit on the rendezvous point, the rendezvous
   point connects the two circuits, and sends a RENDEZVOUS2 cell to the
   client containing the contents of the RENDEZVOUS1 cell.

   Upon receiving the RENDEZVOUS2 cell, the client verifies that the
   HANDSHAKE_INFO correctly completes a handshake. Now both parties use the
   handshake output to derive shared keys for use on the circuit as specified
   in the section below:

4.2.1. Key expansion

   The hidden service and its client need to derive crypto keys from the
   NTOR_KEY_SEED part of the handshake output. To do so, they use the KDF
   construction as follows:

       K = KDF(NTOR_KEY_SEED | m_hsexpand,    HASH_LEN * 3 + S_KEY_LEN * 2)

   The first HASH_LEN bytes of K form KH; the next HASH_LEN form the forward
   digest Df; the next HASH_LEN bytes form the backward digest Db; the next
   S_KEY_LEN bytes form Kf, and the final S_KEY_LEN bytes form Kb.  Excess
   bytes from K are discarded.

   Subsequently, the rendezvous point passes relay cells, unchanged, from each
   of the two circuits to the other.  When Alice's OP sends RELAY cells along
   the circuit, it authenticates with Df, and encrypts them with the Kf, then
   with all of the keys for the ORs in Alice's side of the circuit; and when
   Alice's OP receives RELAY cells from the circuit, it decrypts them with the
   keys for the ORs in Alice's side of the circuit, then decrypts them with Kb,
   and checks integrity with Db.  Bob's OP does the same, with Kf and Kb
   interchanged.

   [TODO: Should we encrypt HANDSHAKE_INFO as we did INTRODUCE2
   contents? It's not necessary, but it could be wise. Similarly, we
   should make it extensible.]

4.3. Using legacy hosts as rendezvous points

   The behavior of ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS is unchanged from older versions
   of this protocol, except that relays should now ignore unexpected
   bytes at the end.

   Old versions of Tor required that RENDEZVOUS cell payloads be exactly
   168 bytes long. All shorter rendezvous payloads should be padded to
   this length with random bytes, to make them difficult to distinguish from
   older protocols at the rendezvous point.

5. Encrypting data between client and host

   A successfully completed handshake, as embedded in the
   INTRODUCE/RENDEZVOUS cells, gives the client and hidden service host
   a shared set of keys Kf, Kb, Df, Db, which they use for sending
   end-to-end traffic encryption and authentication as in the regular
   Tor relay encryption protocol, applying encryption with these keys
   before other encryption, and decrypting with these keys before other
   decryption. The client encrypts with Kf and decrypts with Kb; the
   service host does the opposite.

6. Open Questions:

   Scaling hidden services is hard. There are on-going discussions that
   you might be able to help with. See [SCALING-REFS].

   How can we improve the HSDir unpredictability design proposed in
   [SHAREDRANDOM]? See [SHAREDRANDOM-REFS] for discussion.

   How can hidden service addresses become memorable while retaining
   their self-authenticating and decentralized nature? See
   [HUMANE-HSADDRESSES-REFS] for some proposals; many more are possible.

   Hidden Services are pretty slow. Both because of the lengthy setup
   procedure and because the final circuit has 6 hops. How can we make
   the Hidden Service protocol faster? See [PERFORMANCE-REFS] for some
   suggestions.

Appendix A. Signature scheme with key blinding [KEYBLIND]

  As described in [IMD:DIST] and [SUBCRED] above, we require a "key
  blinding" system that works (roughly) as follows:

        There is a master keypair (sk, pk).

        Given the keypair and a nonce n, there is a derivation function
        that gives a new blinded keypair (sk_n, pk_n).  This keypair can
        be used for signing.

        Given only the public key and the nonce, there is a function
        that gives pk_n.

        Without knowing pk, it is not possible to derive pk_n; without
        knowing sk, it is not possible to derive sk_n.

        It's possible to check that a signature make with sk_n while
        knowing only pk_n.

        Someone who sees a large number of blinded public keys and
        signatures made using those public keys can't tell which
        signatures and which blinded keys were derived from the same
        master keypair.

        You can't forge signatures.

        [TODO: Insert a more rigorous definition and better references.]


  We propose the following scheme for key blinding, based on Ed25519.

  (This is an ECC group, so remember that scalar multiplication is the
  trapdoor function, and it's defined in terms of iterated point
  addition. See the Ed25519 paper [Reference ED25519-REFS] for a fairly
  clear writeup.)

  Let the basepoint be written as B. Assume B has prime order l, so
  lB=0. Let a master keypair be written as (a,A), where a is the private
  key and A is the public key (A=aB).

  To derive the key for a nonce N and an optional secret s, compute the
  blinding factor h as H(A | s, B, N), and let:

      private key for the period:   a' = h a
      public key for the period:    A' = h A = (ha)B

  Generating a signature of M: given a deterministic random-looking r
  (see EdDSA paper), take R=rB, S=r+hash(R,A',M)ah mod l. Send signature
  (R,S) and public key A'.

  Verifying the signature: Check whether SB = R+hash(R,A',M)A'.

  (If the signature is valid,
       SB = (r + hash(R,A',M)ah)B
          = rB + (hash(R,A',M)ah)B
          = R + hash(R,A',M)A' )

  See [KEYBLIND-REFS] for an extensive discussion on this scheme and
  possible alternatives. Also, see [KEYBLIND-PROOF] for a security
  proof of this scheme.

  (To use this with Tor, set N = "key-blind" | INT_8(period-number) |
  INT_8(Start of period in seconds since epoch).)

Appendix C. Recommendations for searching for vanity .onions [VANITY]

  EDITORIAL NOTE: The author thinks that it's silly to brute-force the
  keyspace for a key that, when base-32 encoded, spells out the name of
  your website. It also feels a bit dangerous to me. If you train your
  users to connect to

      llamanymityx4fi3l6x2gyzmtmgxjyqyorj9qsb5r543izcwymle.onion

  I worry that you're making it easier for somebody to trick them into
  connecting to

      llamanymityb4sqi0ta0tsw6uovyhwlezkcrmczeuzdvfauuemle.onion

  Nevertheless, people are probably going to try to do this, so here's a
  decent algorithm to use.

  To search for a public key with some criterion X:

        Generate a random (sk,pk) pair.

        While pk does not satisfy X:

            Add the number 8 to sk
            Add the scalar 8*B to pk

        Return sk, pk.

  We add 8 and 8*B, rather than 1 and B, so that sk is always a valid
  Curve25519 private key, with the lowest 3 bits equal to 0.

  This algorithm is safe [source: djb, personal communication] [TODO:
  Make sure I understood correctly!] so long as only the final (sk,pk)
  pair is used, and all previous values are discarded.

  To parallelize this algorithm, start with an independent (sk,pk) pair
  generated for each independent thread, and let each search proceed
  independently.

  See [VANITY-REFS] for a reference implementation of this vanity .onion
  search scheme.

Appendix D. Numeric values reserved in this document

  [TODO: collect all the lists of commands and values mentioned above]

Appendix E. Reserved numbers

  We reserve these certificate type values for Ed25519 certificates:

      [08] short-term descriptor signing key, signed with blinded
           public key. (Section 2.4)
      [09] intro point authentication key, cross-certifying the descriptor
           signing key. (Section 2.5)
      [10] ed25519 key derived from the curve25519 intro point encryption key,
           cross-certifying the descriptor signing key. (Section 2.5)
