                           Tor network parameters

This file lists the recognized parameters that can appear on the "params"
line of a directory consensus.

1. Network protocol parameters

    "circwindow" -- the default package window that circuits should be
    established with. It started out at 1000 cells, but some research
    indicates that a lower value would mean fewer cells in transit in the
    network at any given time.
    Min: 100, Max: 1000
    First-appeared: Tor 0.2.1.20

    "UseOptimisticData" -- If set to zero, clients by default shouldn't try
    to send optimistic data to servers until they have received a
    RELAY_CONNECTED cell.
    Min: 0, Max: 1, Default: 1
    First-appeared: 0.2.3.3-alpha
    Default was 0 before: 0.2.9.1-alpha
    Removed in 0.4.5.1-alpha; now always on.

    "usecreatefast" -- Used to control whether clients use the CREATE_FAST
    handshake on the first hop of their circuits.
    Min: 0, Max: 1. Default: 1.
    First-appeared: 0.2.4.23, 0.2.5.2-alpha
    Removed in 0.4.5.1-alpha; now always off.

    "min_paths_for_circs_pct" -- A percentage threshold that determines
    whether clients believe they have enough directory information to
    build circuits.  This value applies to the total fraction of
    bandwidth-weighted paths that the client could build; see
    path-spec.txt for more information.
    Min: 25, Max: 95, Default: 60
    First-appeared: 0.2.4

    "ExtendByEd25519ID" -- If true, clients should include Ed25519
    identities for relays when generating EXTEND2 cells.
    Min: 0. Max: 1. Default: 0.
    First-appeared: 0.3.0


2. Performance-tuning parameters

    "CircuitPriorityHalflifeMsec" -- the halflife parameter used when
    weighting which circuit will send the next cell. Obeyed by Tor
    0.2.2.10-alpha and later.  (Versions of Tor between 0.2.2.7-alpha and
    0.2.2.10-alpha recognized a "CircPriorityHalflifeMsec" parameter, but
    mishandled it badly.)
    Min: -1, Max: 2147483647 (INT32_MAX)
    First-appeared: Tor 0.2.2.11-alpha

    "perconnbwrate" and "perconnbwburst" -- if set, each relay sets up a
    separate token bucket for every client OR connection, and rate limits
    that connection indepedently. Typically left unset, except when used for
    performance experiments around trac entry 1750. Only honored by relays
    running Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha and later. (Note that relays running
    0.2.2.7-alpha through 0.2.2.14-alpha looked for bwconnrate and
    bwconnburst, but then did the wrong thing with them; see bug 1830 for
    details.)
    Min: 1, Max: 2147483647 (INT32_MAX)
    First-appeared: 0.2.2.7-alpha
    Removed-in: 0.2.2.16-alpha

    "KISTSchedRunInterval" -- How frequently should the "KIST" scheduler
    run in order to decide which data to write to the network? Value in
    units of milliseconds.  If 0, then the KIST scheduler should be
    disabled.
    Min: 0. Max: 100. Default: 10.
    First appeared: 0.3.2

    "maxunmeasuredbw" -- Used by authorities during voting with method 17 or
    later. The maximum value to give for any Bandwidth= entry for a router
    that isn't based on at least three measurements.
    First-appeared: 0.2.4.11-alpha

    "FastFlagMinThreshold", "FastFlagMaxThreshold" -- lowest and highest
    allowable values for the cutoff for routers that should get the Fast
    flag.  This is used during voting to prevent the threshold for getting
    the Fast flag from being too low or too high.
    FastFlagMinThreshold: Min: 4. Max: INT32_MAX: Default: 4.
    FastFlagMaxThreshold: Min: -. Max: INT32_MAX: Default: INT32_MAX
    First-appeared: 0.2.3.11-alpha

    "AuthDirNumSRVAgreements" -- Minimum number of agreeing directory
    authority votes required for a fresh shared random value to be written in

7. Relay behavior

    "refuseunknownexits" -- if set to one, exit relays look at the previous
    hop of circuits that ask to open an exit stream, and refuse to exit if
    they don't recognize it as a relay. The goal is to make it harder for
    people to use them as one-hop proxies. See trac entry 1751 for details.

    onion-key-rotation-days, default 7)

    Every relay should list each onion key it generates for
    onion-key-rotation-days days after generating it, and then
    replace it.  Relays should continue to accept their most recent
    previous onion key for an additional onion-key-grace-period-days
    days after it is replaced.  (Introduced in 0.3.1.1-alpha;
    prior versions of tor hardcoded both of these values to 7 days.)

    lifetime in seconds that a service should keep an intro point for
    (actual lifetime picked at random between these two values).
