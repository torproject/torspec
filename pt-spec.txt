0. Motivation

  This proposal describes how Tor uses Pluggable Transports (PTs).
  This document is different from pt-spec.txt because it contains
  Tor-specific information, whereas the pt-spec.txt aims to be
  system-independent.

1. Tor PT interface overview

  Pluggable Transports need to implement a specific interface to be
  able to harmoniously coordinate with Tor. This article attempts to
  document this interface.

  TODO: Make this section more useful (SOCKS, ExtORport, etc.)

2. Specification

2.0. Pluggable Transport names

  Tor treats Pluggable Transport names as unique identifiers. No two
  PTs should have the same name.

  Furthermore, PT names MUST be C identifiers. That is, PT names must
  begin with a letter or underscore and the rest of the characters can
  be letters, numbers or underscores. No length limit is imposed. The
  relevant regular expression is "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*".

2.1. Tor Configuration

2.1.0. Client Configuration

  Users use the Tor configuration file (torrc) to specify whether and
  how Pluggable Transports should be used. Specifically, a user is
  expected to use the Bridge and ClientTransportPlugin torrc lines to
  configure their PTs.

2.1.0.0. ClientTransportPlugin lines

  ClientTranportPlugin lines are used to tell Tor about pluggable
  transports. They specify where a PT can be found if it's needed by
  Tor to connect to a bridge.

  The standard format of a ClientTransportPlugin line is:

     ClientTransportPlugin <transports> exec <path> [<options>]

  where <transports> are the (comma-separated) names of the PTs that
  this line specifies. <path> is a filesystem path pointing to an
  executable that can "perform" this PT. <options> are command-line
  arguments and switches that should be used when calling the
  executable.

  As an example:

     ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy --managed

  This line tells Tor to launch the executable at /usr/bin/obfsproxy
  with the command-line switch "--managed". That executable should be
  able to perform two PTs: obfs2 and obfs3.

  If two ClientTransportPlugin lines specify the same PT, Tor SHOULD
  use whichever one is listed first.

  TODO: Document external mode
  TODO: Document '*' transport

2.1.0.1. Bridge lines

  Bridge lines specify how Tor should connect to a bridge. The Bridge
  line format is:

     Bridge [<transport>] <address>:<port> [<id-fingerprint>] [<k>=<v>] [<k>=<v>] [<k>=<v>]

  the PT-specific parts of this format is [transport] and the [k=v]
  values.

  <transport> is the name of the PT that should be used for connecting
  to that bridge, and the <k>=<v> values are PT-specific parameters that
  should be passed to the PT when connecting to this bridge (this
  might include keys, passwords or just PT configuration options) as
  specified in [CLIENTPARAMS].

  Upon encountering such a torrc line, Tor walks through its
  ClientTransportPlugin lines and checks whether there is a line that
  specifies how <transport> is performed.

  If a corresponding ClientTransportPlugin line is found, Tor is
  expected to execute and enable that PT (more on that in [MANAGEDPROXY]).
  If no such line could be found, Tor SHOULD warn the user that there
  is no way to perform that PT.

  When a PT-supporting bridge needs to be used in a Tor circuit, Tor
  uses the PT as a proxy as specified in the paragraph below.

2.1.0.2. Connecting to a bridge through a client PT proxy

  Let's consider a fictitious example of the torrc lines:
ni
    ClientTransportPlugin btc,ltc exec /usr/bin/btcproxy
    Bridge btc 192.0.2.1:6612 tx_size=0.2

  In this case, to connect to the bridge at 192.0.2.1:6612, Tor is
  expected to use the  PT "btc" through the PT proxy at /usr/bin/btcproxy.

  Using the managed proxy protocol (specified in [MANAGEDPROXY]), the
  PT proxy exposes a SOCKS listener and tells Tor its address. Tor
  connects to the SOCKS listener, asks it to connect to 192.0.2.1:6612
  and then sends regular Tor traffic through that SOCKS
  connection. The PT proxy is expected to obfuscate that traffic
  before forwarding it to the bridge.

  Furthermore, since "tx_size=0.2" was specified as a PT-specific
  parameter, Tor needs to pass that to the PT proxy with the method
  specified in [CLIENTPARAMS].

2.1.0.3. Passing PT-specific parameters to a client PT [CLIENTPARAMS]

  If PT-specific parameters are specified in a Bridge line, Tor needs
  to pass them to the PT proxy every time a connection is done to that
  bridge.

  To do so, we (ab)use the authentication of the SOCKS
  protocol. Specifically, if any <k>=<v> values are specified in a
  Bridge line, Tor should join them with semicolons and place them in
  the user and password fields of the SOCKS handshake (splitting them
  across the fields if needed). If a key or value contains a semicolon
  or a backslash, it is escaped with a backslash.

  As an example, if we have:

    Bridge trebuchet 192.0.2.1:6612 rocks=20 height=5.6m

  when connecting to that bridge, Tor is expected to encode the PT
  parameters in the SOCKS handshake as the following string:

    rocks=20;height=5.6m

2.1.1. Server (bridge) Configuration

  Server-side PTs are configured similarly to client proxies. Bridge
  operators use ServerTransportPlugin lines to configure their PTs.

  If a server-side PT requires additional parameters, they need to be
  specified using the ServerTransportOptions torrc parameter.

  Also, instead of using the ORPort, server PTs SHOULD use the
  Extended ORPort to pass data to Tor. The Extended ORPort protocol is
  an ORPort enhanced with an additional metadata channel to carry
  various metadata about client connections (which PT was used, what
  was the actual IP of the client, etc.). The Extended ORPort is
  specified in [EXTORPORT].

2.1.1.0. ServerTransportPlugin lines

  ServerTransportPlugin lines are used to tell Tor about pluggable
  transports. They specify where a PT can be found if it needs to
  provide service for a Tor bridge.

  The standard format of a ServerTransportPlugin line is:

     ServerTransportPlugin <transports> exec <path> [<options>]

  with the same format as ClientTransportPlugin lines.That is,
  <transports> are the (comma-separated) names of the PTs that this
  line specifies. <path> is a filesystem path pointing to an
  executable that can "perform" this PT. <options> are command-line
  arguments and switches that should be used when calling the
  executable.

  Upon encountering a ServerTransportPlugin line, Tor needs to launch
  and configure the corresponding PT using the managed proxy protocol
  (as specified in [MANAGEDPROXY]).

2.1.1.1. Passing PT-specific parameters to a server PT

  Further configuration parameters (like the <k>=<v> values passed to
  client PTs using Bridge lines) can be passed to server PTs using the
  ServerTransportOptions option.

  The format of the ServerTransportOptions line is:
    ServerTransportOptions <transport> <k=v> ...

  For example, a valid instance of this line would be:
    ServerTransportOptions hieroglyphics locale=egypt
  which would pass the parameter "locale=egypt" to the hieroglyphics PT.

  In contrast to the client PT parameters, the server PT parameters
  are valid for the whole runtime of the PT, instead of only being
  used per-connection. They are passed to the PT proxy using the
  managed proxy protocol (as specified in [MANAGEDPROXY]).

2.1.1.2. Specify the bind address of a server PT

  By default, server PTs will bind to IPADDR_ANY and to a random TCP
  port the first time they get launched and will attempt to bind to
  the same port in subsequent runs.

  A bridge operator that wants to specify a different address or port
  should use the ServerTransportListenAddr torrc line. The format of
  such a line is:
    ServerTransportListenAddr <transport> <address:port>

  For example, some valid instances of this line would be:
    ServerTransportListenAddr rot26 98.23.4.45:4200
    ServerTransportListenAddr sound_pt [::]:1025

2.2. Launching PT proxies (managed proxy protocol) [MANAGEDPROXY]

  When Tor is instructed to enable a PT, it launches the executable
  file specified in the ClientTransportPlugin line or the
  ServerTransportPlugin line. This can be done using execve(2) or any
  other process-spawning API.

  After Tor has launched the PT, it needs to coordinate with it to
  make sure that the right transports will be used, that it will bind
  in the proper address/port, etc.

  To achieve this, Tor uses the "managed proxy protocol". This is a
  communication protocol where Tor speaks to the PT using environment
  variables, and the PT replies by printing lines to its stdout.

2.2.0. Tor -> PT communication (environment variables)

   When the Tor client or relay launches a managed proxy, it communicates
   via environment variables.  At a minimum, it sets (in addition to the
   normal environment variables inherited from Tor):

    {Both client and server}

      "TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION" -- A filesystem directory path where the
       PT should store permanent state if it wants to.  This directory
       is not required to exist, but the proxy SHOULD be able to
       create it if it doesn't.  The proxy MUST NOT store state
       elsewhere.
      Example: TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION=/var/lib/tor/pt_state/

      "TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER" -- Used to tell the proxy which
       versions of this configuration protocol Tor supports. Clients
       MUST accept comma-separated lists containing any version that
       they recognise, and MUST work correctly even if some of the
       versions they don't recognise are non-numeric.  Valid version
       characters are non-space, non-comma printable ASCII characters.
      Example: TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER=1,1a,2,4B

    {Client only}

      "TOR_PT_CLIENT_TRANSPORTS" -- A comma-separated list of the PTs
       this client should enable. The proxy SHOULD ignore transport
       names that it doesn't recognise.
      Example: TOR_PT_CLIENT_TRANSPORTS=trebuchet,battering_ram,ballista

      "TOR_PT_PROXY" -- This is the address of an outgoing proxy that
       the pluggable transport proxy should use (see proposal 232 for
       more details). It is in the format:
           <proxy_type>://[<user_name>][:<password>][@]<ip>:<port>
       The TOR_PT_PROXY is optional and can be omitted if there is no
       need to connect to an outgoing proxy.
      Example: socks5://tor:test1234@198.51.100.1:8000
               socks4a://198.51.100.2:8001

    {Server only}

      "TOR_PT_EXTENDED_SERVER_PORT" -- An <address>:<port> where tor
       should be listening for connections speaking the extended
       ORPort protocol (as specified in [EXTORPORT]). If Tor does not
       support the extended ORPort protocol, it MUST use the empty
       string as the value of this environment variable.
      Example: TOR_PT_EXTENDED_SERVER_PORT=127.0.0.1:4200

      "TOR_PT_ORPORT" -- The <address>:<port> of the ORPort of the
       bridge where the PT is supposed to send the deobfuscated
       traffic.
      Example: TOR_PT_ORPORT=127.0.0.1:9001

      "TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR" -- A comma separated list of
       <key>-<value> pairs, where <key> is a transport name and
       <value> is the adress:port on which it should listen for client
       proxy connections.
       The keys holding transport names MUST appear on the same order
       as they appear on TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS.
       This might be the advertised address, or might be a local
       address that Tor will forward ports to.  It MUST be an address
       that will work with bind().
      Example:
        TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR=trebuchet-127.0.0.1:1984,ballista-127.0.0.1:4891

      "TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS" -- A comma-separated list of server
       transports that the proxy should support.  The proxy SHOULD
       ignore transport names that it doesn't recognise.
      Example: TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS=trebuchet,ballista

      "TOR_PT_AUTH_COOKIE_FILE" -- A filesystem path where the proxy
       should expect to find the authentication cookie to be able to
       communicate with the Extended ORPort and TransportControlPort.
       TOR_PT_AUTH_COOKIE_FILE is optional and might not be present in
       the environment of the proxy.
      Example: TOR_PT_AUTH_COOKIE_FILE=/var/lib/tor/extended_orport_auth_cookie

      "TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS" -- A semicolon-separated list
       of <key>:<value> pairs, where <key> is a transport name and
       <value> is a k=v string value with options that are to be
       passed to the transport. Colons, semicolons, equal signs and
       backslashes must be escaped with a backslash.
       The TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS is optional and might not
       be present in the environment of the proxy if no options need
       to be passed to transports.
       Example:
         TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS=scramblesuit:key=banana;automata:rule=110;automata:depth=3
       will pass to 'scramblesuit' the parameter 'key=banana' and to
       'automata' the arguments 'rule=110' and 'depth=3'.

2.2.1. PT -> Tor communication (stdout)

  The transport proxy replies by writing NL-terminated lines to
  stdout.  The line metaformat is:

      <Line> ::= <Keyword> <OptArgs> <NL>
      <Keyword> ::= <KeywordChar> | <Keyword> <KeywordChar>
      <KeyWordChar> ::= <any US-ASCII alphanumeric, dash, and underscore>
      <OptArgs> ::= <Args>*
      <Args> ::= <SP> <ArgChar> | <Args> <ArgChar>
      <ArgChar> ::= <any US-ASCII character but NUL or NL>
      <SP> ::= <US-ASCII whitespace symbol (32)>
      <NL> ::= <US-ASCII newline (line feed) character (10)>

  Tor MUST ignore lines with keywords that it doesn't recognize.

  First, if there's an error parsing the environment variables, the
  proxy should write:
    ENV-ERROR <errormessage>
  and exit.

  If the environment variables were correctly formatted, the proxy
  should write:
    VERSION <configuration protocol version>
  to say that it supports this configuration protocol version (example
  "VERSION 1"). It must either pick a version that Tor told it about
  in TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER, or pick no version at all, say:
     VERSION-ERROR no-version
  and exit.

  The proxy should then open its ports.  If running as a client
  proxy, it should not use fixed ports; instead it should autoselect
  ports to avoid conflicts.  A client proxy should by default only
  listen on localhost for connections.

  A client PT should then tell which transports it has made available
  and how.  It does this by printing zero or more CMETHOD or SMETHOD
  lines to its stdout.

2.2.1.0. Client PT behaviour

2.2.1.0.0. Client PT outgoing proxy (PROXY lines)

  If the client PT is provided with a TOR_PT_PROXY environment
  variable, it MUST make all outgoing network connections via the
  supplied proxy.  If it is unable to do so for any reason (eg:
  malformed value, unsupported proxy type, unreachable proxy
  address), it MUST return a `PROXY_ERROR` and terminate.

  If the value of the TOR_PT_PROXY environment variable is a proxy URL
  usable by the pluggable transport plugin (as specified by proposal
  232-pluggable-transports-through-proxy.txt), the plugin writes to
  stdout:
     PROXY DONE
  On failure it writes:
     PROXY-ERROR <errormessage>

2.2.1.0.1. Client PT configuration (CMETHOD lines)

  Now it's time for the pluggable transport proxy to open its ports.
  A client PT should not use fixed ports; instead it should autoselect
  ports to avoid conflicts.  A client proxy should by default only
  listen on localhost for connections.

  Client PTs report their transports with CMETHOD lines that look like
  this:
   CMETHOD <transport> socks4/socks5 <address:port>
  as in
   CMETHOD trebuchet socks5 127.0.0.1:19999

  The <address:port> is the IP address and TCP port of the SOCKS
  listener that the client PT has exposed.

  If the PT tries to supply a client method but can't for some reason,
  it should say:
    CMETHOD-ERROR <methodname> <errormessage>
  as in
    CMETHOD-ERROR mesh_pt could not find hardware module

  After it is finished telling Tor about the client methods it
  provides, the proxy should print a single "CMETHODS DONE" line.

2.2.1.1. Server PT behaviour (SMETHOD lines)

  A PT tells Tor about the server transports it is providing by
  printing zero or more SMETHOD lines.  These lines look like:
    SMETHOD <methodname> <address:port> [options]

  The 'address:port' part of an SMETHOD line is the address where the
  server PT is listening for incoming client connections.  The
  optional options part is a list of space-separated K:V flags that
  Tor should know about.  Recognised options are:

      - ARGS:K=V,K=V,K=V

        If this option is set, the K=V arguments are added to Tor's
        extrainfo document. Equal signs and commas must be escaped
        with a backslash.

  If there's an error setting up a configured server method, the
  proxy should say:
    SMETHOD-ERROR <methodname> <errormessage>

  After the final SMETHOD line, the proxy says "SMETHODS DONE".

2.2.2. Managed proxy protocol behaviour

  This section specifies some behaviours that Tor and PTs should abide
  too while performing the managed proxy protocol:

  SMETHOD and CMETHOD lines may be interspersed, to allow the proxies to
  report methods as they become available, even when some methods may
  require probing your network, connecting to some kind of peers, etc
  before they are set up.

  The proxy SHOULD NOT tell Tor about a server or client method
  unless it is actually open and ready to use.

  Tor clients SHOULD NOT use any method from a client proxy or
  advertise any method from a server proxy UNLESS it is listed as a
  possible method for that proxy in torrc, and it is listed by the
  proxy as a method it supports.

  The managed proxy configuration protocol version defined in this
  section is "1".
  So, for example, if tor supports this configuration protocol it
  should set the environment variable:
    TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER=1

2.3. Extended ORPort [EXTORPORT]

  Server-side PTs SHOULD pass additional information about their
  clients to Tor for statistics gathering. This is done using the
  Extended ORPort protocol, which is a variant of the ORPort with an
  extra metadata channel.

  As an example, PTs are expected to use the Extended ORPort metadata
  channel to inform Tor about the PT used in each connection, so that
  Tor can keep track on the number of connections per PT.

  The Extended ORPort protocol is specified in proposal
  196-transport-control-ports.txt.
