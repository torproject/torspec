0. Motivation

  This specification describes how Tor uses Pluggable Transports (PTs).
  This document is different from pt-spec.txt because it contains
  Tor-specific information, whereas the pt-spec.txt aims to be
  system-independent.

1. Tor PT interface overview

  Pluggable Transports must implement a specific interface to be able to
  harmoniously coordinate with Tor. This article attempts to document
  this interface.

  TODO: Make this section more useful (SOCKS, ExtORport, etc.)

2. Specification

2.0. Pluggable Transport names

  Tor treats Pluggable Transport names as unique identifiers. Every PT
  MUST have a unique name.

  Furthermore, PT names MUST be C identifiers. That is, PT names MUST
  begin with a letter or underscore and the rest of the characters be
  letters, numbers or underscores. No length limit is imposed.

  PT names MUST satisfy the regular expression "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*".

2.1. Tor Configuration

2.1.0. Client Configuration

  Users use the Tor configuration file (torrc) to specify if and how
  Pluggable Transports should be used. Specifically, a user is expected
  to use the Bridge and ClientTransportPlugin torrc lines to configure
  their PTs.

2.1.0.0. ClientTransportPlugin torrc lines

  ClientTranportPlugin torrc lines are used by Tor to configure
  Pluggable Transports. They specify the location of the PT executable,
  and which PT protocols the executable is able to perform.

  The standard format of a ClientTransportPlugin line is:

     ClientTransportPlugin <transports> exec <path> [<options>]

  where <transports> are the (comma-separated) names of the PTs that
  this line specifies. <path> is a filesystem path pointing to an
  executable that can "perform" this PT. <options> are (optional)
  command-line arguments and switches that should be used when
  invoking the executable.

  For example:

     ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy --managed

  This line tells Tor to launch the executable "/usr/bin/obfsproxy" with
  the command-line switch "--managed". That executable should be able to
  perform two PTs: obfs2 and obfs3.

  If two ClientTransportPlugin lines specify the same PT, Tor SHOULD use
  whichever one is listed first.

  TODO: Document external mode
  TODO: Document '*' transport

2.1.0.1. Bridge torrc lines

  Bridge lines specify how Tor should connect to a bridge. The Bridge
  line format is:

     Bridge [<transport>] <address>:<port> [<id-fingerprint>] [<k>=<v>] [<k>=<v>] [<k>=<v>]

  The PT-specific parts of this format are the [transport] and [k=v]
  values.

  <transport> is the name of the PT that MUST be used when connecting to
  the bridge, and the <k>=<v> values are PT-specific parameters that
  MUST be passed to the PT when connecting to the bridge (this MAY
  include keys, passwords or other PT configuration options) as
  specified in [CLIENTPARAMS].

  Upon encountering such a Bridge line in the torrc, Tor iterates over
  the ClientTransportPlugin lines and checks if there is a line that
  specifies how <transport> is performed.

  If a corresponding ClientTransportPlugin line is found, Tor is
  expected to execute and enable that PT via the process specified in
  [MANAGEDPROXY]. If no such line could be found, Tor SHOULD warn the
  user that there is no way to perform that PT.

  When a PT-supporting bridge needs to be used in a Tor circuit, Tor
  uses the PT as a proxy as specified in 2.1.0.2.

2.1.0.2. Connecting to a bridge via a client PT proxy

  Consider a fictitious example of the torrc lines:

    ClientTransportPlugin btc,ltc exec /usr/bin/btcproxy
    Bridge btc 192.0.2.1:6612 tx_size=0.2

  In this example, to connect to the bridge at 192.0.2.1:6612, Tor is
  expected to use the PT "btc" via the PT proxy at /usr/bin/btcproxy.

  Using the managed proxy protocol (specified in [MANAGEDPROXY]), the PT
  proxy exposes a SOCKS proxy server and informs Tor of the address.
  Tor connects to 192.0.2.1:6612 via the PT SOCKS proxy and routes
  regular Tor traffic through the SOCKS connection. The PT proxy is
  expected to transform the Tor traffic to and from the bridge.

  Furthermore, as "tx_size=0.2" was specified as a PT-specific
  parameter, Tor will pass that to the PT proxy via the method specified
  in [CLIENTPARAMS].

2.1.0.3. Passing PT-specific parameters to a client PT [CLIENTPARAMS]

  If PT-specific parameters are specified in a Bridge line, Tor MUST
  pass them to the PT proxy every time a connection is made to that
  bridge.

  To do so, the authentication mechanism of the SOCKS protocol is
  (ab)used. Specifically, if any <k>=<v> values are specified in a
  Bridge line, Tor should join them with semicolons and place them in
  the user and password fields of the SOCKS handshake (splitting them
  across the fields if needed). If a key or value contains a semicolon
  or a backslash, it is escaped with a backslash.

  For example:

    Bridge trebuchet 192.0.2.1:6612 rocks=20 height=5.6m

  when connecting to that bridge, Tor is expected to encode the PT
  parameters in the SOCKS handshake as the following string:

    rocks=20;height=5.6m

2.1.1. Server (bridge) Configuration

  Server-side PTs are configured similarly to client proxies. Bridge
  operators use ServerTransportPlugin lines to configure their PTs.

  If a server-side PT requires additional parameters, they need to be
  specified using the ServerTransportOptions torrc parameter.

  Also, instead of using the ORPort, server PTs SHOULD use the
  Extended ORPort to pass data to Tor. The Extended ORPort protocol is
  an ORPort enhanced with an additional metadata channel to carry
  various metadata about client connections (which PT was used, what
  was the actual IP of the client, etc.). The Extended ORPort is
  specified in [EXTORPORT].

2.1.1.0. ServerTransportPlugin lines

  ServerTransportPlugin lines are used to tell Tor about pluggable
  transports. They specify where a PT can be found if it needs to
  provide service for a Tor bridge.

  The standard format of a ServerTransportPlugin line is:

     ServerTransportPlugin <transports> exec <path> [<options>]

  with the same format as ClientTransportPlugin lines.That is,
  <transports> are the (comma-separated) names of the PTs that this
  line specifies. <path> is a filesystem path pointing to an
  executable that can "perform" this PT. <options> are command-line
  arguments and switches that should be used when calling the
  executable.

  Upon encountering a ServerTransportPlugin line, Tor needs to launch
  and configure the corresponding PT using the managed proxy protocol
  (as specified in [MANAGEDPROXY]).

2.1.1.1. Passing PT-specific parameters to a server PT

  Further configuration parameters (like the <k>=<v> values passed to
  client PTs using Bridge lines) can be passed to server PTs using the
  ServerTransportOptions option.

  The format of the ServerTransportOptions line is:
    ServerTransportOptions <transport> <k=v> ...

  For example, a valid instance of this line would be:
    ServerTransportOptions hieroglyphics locale=egypt
  which would pass the parameter "locale=egypt" to the hieroglyphics PT.

  In contrast to the client PT parameters, the server PT parameters
  are valid for the whole runtime of the PT, instead of only being
  used per-connection. They are passed to the PT proxy using the
  managed proxy protocol (as specified in [MANAGEDPROXY]).

2.1.1.2. Specify the bind address of a server PT

  By default, server PTs will bind to IPADDR_ANY and to a random TCP
  port the first time they get launched and will attempt to bind to
  the same port in subsequent runs.

  A bridge operator that wants to specify a different address or port
  should use the ServerTransportListenAddr torrc line. The format of
  such a line is:
    ServerTransportListenAddr <transport> <address:port>

  For example, some valid instances of this line would be:
    ServerTransportListenAddr rot26 98.23.4.45:4200
    ServerTransportListenAddr sound_pt [::]:1025

2.2. Launching PT proxies (managed proxy protocol) [MANAGEDPROXY]

  When Tor is instructed to enable a PT, it launches the executable
  file specified in the ClientTransportPlugin line or the
  ServerTransportPlugin line. This can be done using execve(2) or any
  other process-spawning API.

  After Tor has launched the PT, the PT must be configured to ensure
  that the right transports will be used, that it will bind in the
  proper address/port, etc.

  To achieve this, Tor and the PT use the "managed proxy protocol". This
  is a communication protocol where Tor speaks to the PT using
  environment variables, and the PT replies by printing lines to its
  stdout.

2.2.0. Tor -> PT communication (environment variables)

   When the Tor client or relay launches a managed proxy, it communicates
   via environment variables. At a minimum, TOR MUST set the following
   enviornment variables:

    {Both client and server}

      "TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION" -- A filesystem directory path where the
       PT is allowed to store permanent state if required. This
       directory is not required to exist, but the proxy SHOULD be able
       to create it if it does not. The proxy MUST NOT store state
       elsewhere.
      Example: TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION=/var/lib/tor/pt_state/

      "TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER" -- Used to tell the proxy which
       versions of this configuration protocol Tor supports. Clients
       MUST accept comma-separated lists containing any version that
       they recognise, and MUST work correctly even if some of the
       versions they do not recognise are non-numeric. Valid version
       characters are non-space, non-comma printable ASCII characters.
      Example: TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER=1,1a,2,4B

    {Client only}

      "TOR_PT_CLIENT_TRANSPORTS" -- A comma-separated list of the PTs
       this client should enable. The proxy SHOULD ignore transport
       names that it doesn't recognise.
      Example: TOR_PT_CLIENT_TRANSPORTS=trebuchet,battering_ram,ballista

      "TOR_PT_PROXY" -- This is the address of an outgoing proxy that
       the pluggable transport proxy MUST use (see proposal 232 for more
       details). It is of the format:
           <proxy_type>://[<user_name>][:<password>][@]<ip>:<port>
       The TOR_PT_PROXY is optional and MAY be omitted if there is no
       need to connect via an outgoing proxy.
      Example: socks5://tor:test1234@198.51.100.1:8000
               socks4a://198.51.100.2:8001

    {Server only}

      "TOR_PT_EXTENDED_SERVER_PORT" -- An <address>:<port> where Tor
       should be listening for connections speaking the extended
       ORPort protocol (as specified in [EXTORPORT]). If Tor does not
       support the extended ORPort protocol, it MUST use the empty
       string as the value of this environment variable.
      Example: TOR_PT_EXTENDED_SERVER_PORT=127.0.0.1:4200

      "TOR_PT_ORPORT" -- The <address>:<port> of the ORPort of the
       bridge where the PT is supposed to send the deobfuscated
       traffic.
      Example: TOR_PT_ORPORT=127.0.0.1:9001

      "TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR" -- A comma separated list of
       <key>-<value> pairs, where <key> is a transport name and
       <value> is the adress:port on which it should listen for client
       proxy connections.
       The keys holding transport names MUST be in the same order as
       they are in TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS. This might be the
       advertised address, or might be a local address that Tor will
       forward ports to. It MUST be an address that will work with
       bind().
      Example:
        TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR=trebuchet-127.0.0.1:1984,ballista-127.0.0.1:4891

      "TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS" -- A comma-separated list of server
       transports that the proxy should support. The proxy SHOULD
       ignore transport names that it doesn't recognise.
      Example: TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS=trebuchet,ballista

      "TOR_PT_AUTH_COOKIE_FILE" -- A filesystem path where the proxy
       should expect to find the authentication cookie to be able to
       communicate with the Extended ORPort and TransportControlPort.
       TOR_PT_AUTH_COOKIE_FILE is optional and might not be present in
       the environment of the proxy.
      Example: TOR_PT_AUTH_COOKIE_FILE=/var/lib/tor/extended_orport_auth_cookie

      "TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS" -- A semicolon-separated list
       of <key>:<value> pairs, where <key> is a transport name and
       <value> is a k=v string value with options that are to be passed
       to the transport. Colons, semicolons, equal signs and backslashes
       MUST be escaped with a backslash. TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS
       is optional and might not be present in the environment of the
       proxy if no options are need to be passed to transports.
       Example:
         TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS=scramblesuit:key=banana;automata:rule=110;automata:depth=3
       will pass to 'scramblesuit' the parameter 'key=banana' and to
       'automata' the arguments 'rule=110' and 'depth=3'.

2.2.1. PT -> Tor communication (stdout)

  The transport proxy replies by writing NL-terminated lines to
  stdout. The line metaformat is:

      <Line> ::= <Keyword> <OptArgs> <NL>
      <Keyword> ::= <KeywordChar> | <Keyword> <KeywordChar>
      <KeyWordChar> ::= <any US-ASCII alphanumeric, dash, and underscore>
      <OptArgs> ::= <Args>*
      <Args> ::= <SP> <ArgChar> | <Args> <ArgChar>
      <ArgChar> ::= <any US-ASCII character but NUL or NL>
      <SP> ::= <US-ASCII whitespace symbol (32)>
      <NL> ::= <US-ASCII newline (line feed) character (10)>

  Tor MUST ignore lines with keywords that it does not recognize.

  If there is an error parsing the environment variables, the proxy
  SHOULD write:
    ENV-ERROR <errormessage>
  and exit.

  If the environment variables were correctly formatted, the proxy
  should write:
    VERSION <configuration protocol version>
  to announce the supported configuration protocol version (eg:
  "VERSION 1"). It MUST either pick a version among those listed in the
  TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER enviornment variable. If no supported
  versions are listed in the enviornment variable the proxy SHOULD
  write:
     VERSION-ERROR no-version
  and exit.

  The proxy should then open its ports. If running as a client
  proxy, it SHOULD NOT use fixed ports; instead it SHOULD autoselect
  ports to avoid conflicts. A client proxy SHOULD only listen on the
  loopback interface for connections by default.

  A PT should then tell which transports it has made available and how.
  It does this by printing zero or more CMETHOD (client) or SMETHOD
  (server) lines to its stdout.

2.2.1.0. Client PT behaviour

2.2.1.0.0. Client PT outgoing proxy (PROXY lines)

  If the client PT is provided with a TOR_PT_PROXY environment variable,
  it MUST make all outgoing network connections via the supplied proxy.
  If it is unable to do so for any reason (eg: malformed value,
  unsupported proxy type, unreachable proxy address), it MUST return a
  `PROXY_ERROR` and terminate.

  If the value of the TOR_PT_PROXY environment variable is a proxy URL
  usable by the pluggable transport plugin (as specified by proposal
  232-pluggable-transports-through-proxy.txt), the plugin writes to
  stdout:
     PROXY DONE
  On failure it writes:
     PROXY-ERROR <errormessage>

2.2.1.0.1. Client PT configuration (CMETHOD lines)

  Client PTs report their transports via zero or more CMETHOD lines,
  with the following format:
   CMETHOD <transport> socks4/socks5 <address:port>
  For example:
   CMETHOD trebuchet socks5 127.0.0.1:19999

  The 'address:port' component of a CMETHOD line is the IP address and
  TCP port of the SOCKS proxy server the client PT has exposed.

  If the PT tries to supply a client method but can not for some
  reason, it MUST write:
    CMETHOD-ERROR <methodname> <errormessage>
  For example:
    CMETHOD-ERROR trebuchet no rocks available

  After it is finished communicating all of the client methods it
  provides, the proxy MUST print a single "CMETHODS DONE" line.  At this
  point the managed proxy configuration is complete.

2.2.1.1. Server PT behaviour (SMETHOD lines)

  Server PTs report their transports via  zero or more SMETHOD lines,
  with the following format:
    SMETHOD <methodname> <address:port> [options]

  The 'address:port' component of a SMETHOD line is the IP address and
  port where the server PT is listening for incoming client connections.
  The optional 'options' component is a list of space-separated K:V
  flags that Tor should know about. Recognised options are:

      - ARGS:K=V,K=V,K=V

        If this option is set, the K=V arguments are added to Tor's
        extrainfo document. Equal signs and commas must be escaped
        with a backslash.

  If the PT tries to supply a server method but can not for some
  reason, it MUST write:
    SMETHOD-ERROR <methodname> <errormessage>

  After it is finished communicating all of the server methods it
  provides, the PT should print a single "SMETHODS DONE" line.  At
  this point the server PT configuration is complete.

2.2.2. Managed proxy protocol behaviour

  This section specifies some behaviours that Tor and PTs SHOULD abide
  too while performing the managed proxy protocol:

  SMETHOD and CMETHOD lines may be interspersed, to allow the proxies to
  report methods as they become available, even when some methods may
  require probing the network, connecting to external peers, etc before
  they are set up.

  The proxy SHOULD NOT tell Tor about a server or client method
  unless it is actually open and ready to use.

  Tor clients SHOULD NOT use any method from a client proxy or
  advertise any method from a server proxy UNLESS it is listed as a
  possible method for that proxy in torrc, and it is listed by the
  proxy as a method it supports.

  The managed proxy configuration protocol version defined in this
  section is "1".
  So, for example, if tor supports this configuration protocol it
  should set the environment variable:
    TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER=1

2.3. Extended ORPort [EXTORPORT]

  Server-side PTs SHOULD pass additional information about their clients
  to Tor for statistics gathering. This is done using the Extended
  ORPort protocol, which is a variant of the ORPort with an extra
  metadata channel.

  For example, PTs are expected to use the Extended ORPort metadata
  channel to inform Tor about the PT used in each connection, so that
  Tor can keep track on the number of connections per PT.

  The Extended ORPort protocol is specified in proposal
  196-transport-control-ports.txt.
